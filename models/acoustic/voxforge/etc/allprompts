Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND

Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
Aaron-20080318-kdl/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
Aaron-20080318-lbb/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS

Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
Aaron-20080318-lbk/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
Aaron-20080318-liy/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL

Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
Aaron-20080318-ngh/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES

Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
Aaron-20080318-pwn/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITE SENSATION
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
abc-20091120-mfr/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
ada-20090105-axq/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT

adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
adamvan2000-20090911-njp/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
adgar-20091227-ell/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
adgar-20091227-ell/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
adgar-20091227-ell/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
adgar-20091227-ell/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR

ahbigalex10-20090529-owx/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS

aileen-20080831-dfq/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY

aileen-20080831-ema/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
aileen-20080831-ema/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
aileen-20080831-ema/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED

aileen-20080831-ema/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
aileen-20080831-ema/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE

aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL

aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
aileen-20080831-sgd/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS

aileen-20080831-zdn/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
akiplaner-20091214-bxe/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
akiplaner-20091214-dya/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
akiplaner-20091214-dya/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
akiplaner-20091214-dya/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
akiplaner-20091214-dya/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
akiplaner-20091214-dya/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
akiplaner-20091214-ivd/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES

akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
akiplaner-20091214-kar/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT

akiplaner-20091214-ozt/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
akiplaner-20091214-ozt/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
akiplaner-20091214-ozt/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
akiplaner-20091214-ozt/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
akiplaner-20091214-ozt/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT

akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
akiplaner-20091214-vkw/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
akiplaner-20091214-woc/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
akiplaner-20091214-xat/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
akiplaner-20091214-yam/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
akiplaner-20091215-bbg/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
akiplaner-20091215-iha/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
akiplaner-20091215-xnz/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
akiplaner-20091215-zqu/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
akiplaner-20091217-jso/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
akiplaner-20091217-mnm/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
akiplaner-20091217-rws/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
akiplaner-20091217-zgx/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
akiplaner-20091219-eyz/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
akiplaner-20091219-fyp/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
akiplaner-20091219-qvh/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
akiplaner-20091219-rgn/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
akiplaner-20091224-tml/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
akiplaner-20100102-bmj/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
alec-20090912-aws/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
alec-20090912-hhr/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
alec-20090912-jip/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
alec-20090912-otq/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
alexfoster-20090217-qwu/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT

alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
alig-20091130-aha/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
alig-20091130-msk/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
alphadecay-20090623-dmq/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
alphadecay-20090623-epc/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
alphadecay-20090623-wtn/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN

Angus-20080320-mih/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Angus-20080320-mih/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS

anonymous-20071025-ewv/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20071025-ewv/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous-20071025-ewv/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20071025-lvi/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous-20071027-xjk/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20071101-vet/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20071105-hwr/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20071115-aam/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous-20071115-acx/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
anonymous-20071115-drs/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20071115-puf/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous-20071115-skx/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20071115-yze/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20071115-yzs/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous-20071118-upj/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous-20071124-zgu/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20071125-xna/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous-20071126-wpp/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20071127-rln/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20071128-qbd/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous-20071208-hvn/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous-20071209-shm/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20071220-zqp/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous-20071225-mnx/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous-20071227-ibt/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20071228-eqs/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
anonymous-20080102-hrx/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20080117-jkd/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous-20080117-wqy/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous-20080119-hjn/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20080119-jca/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20080119-pxh/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous-20080121-cjq/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20080127-fcu/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20080127-owy/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20080130-gxn/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous-20080204-hnl/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous-20080204-hzw/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous-20080214-gkv/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous-20080215-nae/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous-20080216-yrh/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous-20080220-eih/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous-20080224-tew/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20080225-awl/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous-20080225-ruq/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous-20080227-twp/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous-20080228-jwv/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous-20080229-sjo/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous-20080303-mlo/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20080314-foa/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20080314-qzg/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous-20080315-nvj/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20080316-jej/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous-20080317-ibg/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20080317-zvr/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20080318-eaq/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20080318-ymo/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
anonymous-20080320-lpb/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous-20080321-gln/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous-20080324-fvz/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous-20080324-gvb/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous-20080328-drd/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
anonymous-20080328-mmv/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous-20080329-bww/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous-20080329-oxi/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20080401-kbc/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous-20080403-ela/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20080406-rne/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20080406-zsg/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous-20080407-gfc/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous-20080407-gvg/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous-20080408-sqi/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20080410-cyq/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20080413-aso/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous-20080413-dto/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20080414-daq/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous-20080415-odt/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous-20080417-ehq/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20080417-txe/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous-20080419-jam/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20080425-atw/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous-20080425-ojw/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20080426-gcs/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20080426-ned/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous-20080426-qvq/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous-20080428-cxb/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous-20080428-rfr/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20080505-hxb/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous-20080505-ivc/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous-20080505-pjm/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous-20080510-kln/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous-20080510-kln/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20080510-kln/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous-20080510-kln/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE

anonymous-20080510-kln/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous-20080510-mjm/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING

anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20080511-noz/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20080516-sjn/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE

anonymous-20080516-sjn/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous-20080516-tfh/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous-20080517-sgv/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20080517-tca/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous-20080517-tzn/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20080520-ami/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous-20080520-aqx/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20080520-bmj/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20080520-dqq/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20080520-lsg/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20080520-qgl/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20080520-wcn/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20080521-tfx/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20080524-wjg/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous-20080524-zhd/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous-20080526-rom/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20080527-okm/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous-20080527-pbb/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous-20080528-bbw/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20080602-ttd/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20080603-vhl/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0327 HE HAD SO EASY
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0331 HIS STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous-20080605-mcr/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous-20080605-yjk/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20080606-ijr/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20080608-dya/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS

anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous-20080608-xxy/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN

anonymous-20080611-lqr/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY

anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED

anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous-20080612-vow/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER

anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous-20080616-fxp/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20080617-bhy/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE 
anonymous-20080618-qsd/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous-20080621-gtr/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT

anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous-20080621-img/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20080621-jwy/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous-20080623-suj/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous-20080625-otd/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20080625-qss/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0138 HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous-20080626-bwy/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0111 AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0118 OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous-20080627-ysj/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20080628-lkq/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20080630-eki/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous-20080630-eki/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN

anonymous-20080702-bam/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous-20080702-bam/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20080702-bam/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20080702-bam/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous-20080702-bam/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous-20080702-jqa/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART

anonymous-20080702-jqa/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous-20080702-jqa/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20080702-oqm/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous-20080702-ucr/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20080703-uaj/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20080707-rvs/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous-20080709-vaq/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20080712-vdc/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20080713-hdg/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous-20080713-wxa/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0220 BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous-20080713-xus/wav/b0229 I SAW IT MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous-20080715-amy/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20080715-ikt/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20080715-zdu/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous-20080716-sfu/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20080722-btg/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20080722-rqt/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20080727-dyo/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0076 THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0078 THEN AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0081 DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20080727-olk/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous-20080731-jyq/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous-20080801-qki/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous-20080805-tjs/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous-20080806-eix/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous-20080806-gvj/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20080806-org/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20080806-wxv/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL

anonymous-20080830-zqj/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20080830-zqj/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB

anonymous-20080902-ssk/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous-20080902-ssk/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT

anonymous-20080906-zwn/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS

anonymous-20080907-cja/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous-20080907-cja/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous-20080907-cja/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN

anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20080907-dfn/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20080907-die/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20080907-die/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20080907-die/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20080907-die/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous-20080907-die/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE

anonymous-20080907-ndt/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20080907-ndt/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG

anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED
anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous-20080907-oox/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous-20080907-phf/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous-20080907-ssq/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous-20080907-svz/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20080907-uue/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20080907-xeb/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20080907-xtn/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20080907-yme/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous-20080908-jzy/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20080911-off/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous-20080912-cdd/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0033 TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0035 AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous-20080912-pgg/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0510 TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous-20080912-wcp/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20080913-akr/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous-20080913-glw/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20080914-gsb/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARK
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20080918-neg/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous-20080919-xbg/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20080919-xlh/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous-20080921-sau/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20080921-vgf/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous-20080922-syf/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20080923-bvu/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20080927-shd/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous-20080928-ghu/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20080929-fuw/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20080929-olb/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous-20080930-gyh/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20081001-xjx/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20081001-ztn/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous-20081002-ozn/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20081003-thp/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous-20081005-iji/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20081006-yxy/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous-20081008-hds/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20081010-uhe/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous-20081014-cui/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous-20081014-kvt/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20081014-pzr/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous-20081014-umx/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous-20081014-xmt/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous-20081015-rdx/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous-20081016-qlb/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN

anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20081020-lkw/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20081022-apb/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20081023-jpl/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20081024-jvl/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous-20081025-crv/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous-20081025-fxv/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20081025-hmo/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20081025-omh/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20081026-awi/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20081026-eot/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous-20081026-ewe/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous-20081026-qbt/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20081026-tua/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT

anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous-20081026-xqp/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20081027-njq/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED

anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous-20081027-okq/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20081027-shw/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY

anonymous-20081027-shw/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous-20081027-shw/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous-20081027-shw/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous-20081027-srq/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20081027-yle/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE

anonymous-20081027-yle/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20081027-yle/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB

anonymous-20081027-zih/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20081027-zih/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION

anonymous-20081027-zih/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous-20081027-zih/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER

anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous-20081029-jwg/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous-20081029-ycy/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT

anonymous-20081029-ycy/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM

anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20081103-ffc/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20081105-zoq/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20081105-zoq/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20081105-zoq/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20081105-zoq/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20081105-zoq/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED

anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous-20081109-jmd/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20081109-jtu/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20081110-rvw/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20081111-bnf/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
anonymous-20081111-hle/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20081111-nwx/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
anonymous-20081111-rjw/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20081114-hhv/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20081116-pfp/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20081116-xvn/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20081117-dep/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20081118-ske/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous-20081120-knf/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20081123-fnv/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous-20081123-jam/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20081123-twp/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20081124-nrx/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20081125-emk/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
anonymous-20081127-pjg/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20081129-qmq/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20081129-tmz/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous-20081201-ddl/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous-20081201-kae/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20081202-voy/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20081202-yga/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20081203-ers/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0329 INDEED
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous-20081203-rst/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20081208-som/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20081209-vqq/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20081211-mil/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20081212-mhh/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADY
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED
anonymous-20081212-tss/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20081213-dhm/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20081213-xhi/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20081217-aop/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous-20081217-efe/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous-20081217-gef/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous-20081217-xbq/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous-20081217-xtu/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20081221-htm/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous-20081224-hlg/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous-20081225-afe/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20081227-ptr/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20090102-qmm/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20090102-xcu/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20090106-jzn/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20090106-uqf/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20090108-vtw/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous-20090114-jwb/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous-20090115-lgb/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous-20090116-obg/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous-20090117-mam/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20090117-pzl/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous-20090118-cjz/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20090118-wgx/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous-20090119-efi/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous-20090119-qob/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous-20090121-bac/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20090121-bgm/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090121-buj/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous-20090121-cqx/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20090121-cyt/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous-20090121-eft/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20090121-etx/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous-20090121-hkf/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous-20090121-ifd/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20090121-ixf/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20090121-ncp/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20090121-nik/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20090121-own/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20090121-pya/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous-20090121-rgi/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous-20090121-slp/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20090121-uax/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20090121-ubx/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20090121-wjq/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20090121-znn/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous-20090122-aka/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous-20090128-owh/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous-20090131-xuu/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20090201-bel/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous-20090201-hjy/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous-20090201-jtw/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous-20090203-rbs/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20090204-cbj/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous-20090208-dqm/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous-20090209-ukf/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20090210-grk/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20090210-hom/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous-20090210-vmj/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20090210-wct/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous-20090214-ctf/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20090215-yad/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous-20090217-jwf/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20090217-sot/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20090218-dec/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20090218-klq/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20090218-xan/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20090220-tna/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20090224-jgu/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0227 SHORT RETURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20090224-ugp/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20090225-bqo/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous-20090226-ctx/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous-20090226-ury/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous-20090228-eem/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20090301-xbk/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20090302-qaf/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20090302-vai/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20090304-jap/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION

anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20090305-wts/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090306-vmr/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous-20090307-xgh/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0317 IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous-20090308-ifu/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20090310-cfk/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous-20090310-jri/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20090311-icj/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous-20090312-pmf/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous-20090313-vjx/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20090314-nzb/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20090314-sdz/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous-20090315-zqt/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous-20090316-msn/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20090316-slm/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous-20090316-xhp/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20090319-cxz/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous-20090321-woy/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous-20090322-lhq/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20090323-jnf/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous-20090323-upt/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous-20090325-ayb/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous-20090326-ekm/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0159 SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20090330-lfh/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20090331-zxo/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous-20090403-puy/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous-20090403-sek/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous-20090403-vjg/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20090403-ztj/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090404-lxa/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous-20090406-dtr/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20090406-evj/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20090406-ifh/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20090415-ocs/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20090415-xuj/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20090417-cbk/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous-20090417-jqz/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous-20090417-lyd/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20090417-nop/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20090417-pal/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous-20090417-pyl/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous-20090417-suo/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous-20090417-tzj/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

anonymous-20090417-ygz/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20090417-ygz/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous-20090417-ygz/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

anonymous-20090417-zby/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20090417-zby/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20090417-zby/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20090417-zby/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20090422-syd/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20090426-awr/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20090426-crp/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20090426-crp/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20090426-crp/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20090426-crp/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090426-crp/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES

anonymous-20090428-uun/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous-20090428-uun/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

anonymous-20090429-bmm/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090429-bmm/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20090429-bmm/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20090429-bmm/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED

anonymous-20090430-bme/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20090430-bme/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

anonymous-20090501-jnl/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20090501-jnl/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL

anonymous-20090503-sul/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20090503-sul/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20090503-sul/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090503-sul/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20090503-sul/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE

anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES

anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20090505-bsq/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous-20090506-kns/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN

anonymous-20090506-kns/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20090506-kns/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous-20090509-ibz/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous-20090509-ikz/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20090509-jss/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous-20090509-lbn/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20090512-ogs/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN

anonymous-20090512-qqm/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20090512-yoh/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE

anonymous-20090513-yua/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
anonymous-20090513-yua/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
anonymous-20090513-yua/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR

anonymous-20090519-hxd/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20090519-hxd/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM

anonymous-20090527-frh/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous-20090527-frh/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG

anonymous-20090528-gzi/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20090528-gzi/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20090528-gzi/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND

anonymous-20090528-sfs/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO

anonymous-20090530-ese/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous-20090530-ese/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous-20090530-ese/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous-20090530-ese/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20090530-ese/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20090530-fkx/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYE
anonymous-20090530-jlu/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20090530-myu/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anonymous-20090530-wtm/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous-20090530-zfo/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20090531-fhg/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous-20090531-wmi/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20090601-zrt/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP

anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20090603-lzd/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING

anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20090605-dlc/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20090605-iyu/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS

anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous-20090605-ndd/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous-20090605-vxz/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous-20090606-iot/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20090606-iot/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090606-iot/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous-20090606-iot/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous-20090606-whl/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous-20090606-whl/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous-20090606-whl/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP

anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY

anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous-20090606-wqm/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
anonymous-20090606-yyv/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE

anonymous-20090606-yyv/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20090606-yyv/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20090606-yyv/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous-20090606-yyv/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous-20090607-fsh/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20090607-fsh/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS

anonymous-20090615-xgs/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous-20090615-xgs/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20090615-xgs/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20090615-xgs/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM

anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous-20090618-emm/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
anonymous-20090619-bdl/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous-20090621-jzf/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20090621-tzs/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous-20090623-jhj/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20090624-reh/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20090626-gyb/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL

anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20090626-wxv/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20090630-evt/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20090701-znv/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous-20090702-ihb/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY

anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous-20090703-nua/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous-20090704-dhe/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous-20090704-dhe/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous-20090704-dhe/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous-20090704-dhe/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous-20090704-dhe/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS

anonymous-20090704-jan/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous-20090704-jan/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS

anonymous-20090707-ukn/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20090707-ukn/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous-20090707-ukn/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous-20090707-ukn/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS

anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20090709-vhw/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20090710-rsd/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous-20090710-rsd/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous-20090710-rsd/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE

anonymous-20090710-rsd/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous-20090710-rsd/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20090711-asg/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20090711-eod/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM

anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20090711-zoe/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090711-zqd/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous-20090715-nhl/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous-20090715-yrn/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous-20090716-lwl/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous-20090717-rti/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090720-lcc/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20090722-fgs/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20090722-vub/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20090722-zxx/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0180 I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN GODSEND TO ME
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous-20090726-dqn/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20090727-dmh/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous-20090729-ddh/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20090729-qma/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous-20090731-tfj/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20090805-eal/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20090806-fmb/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20090806-yeg/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous-20090809-nqo/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous-20090809-zoh/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous-20090810-hqe/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20090813-yzn/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous-20090817-vai/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous-20090819-cdi/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous-20090820-hhh/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20090823-suf/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20090824-ipw/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0195 BUT SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER
anonymous-20090825-sqq/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20090826-kak/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20090827-hcn/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20090827-pdr/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous-20090830-opn/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20090901-ccb/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous-20090901-fvw/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20090901-hvd/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20090901-qkb/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
anonymous-20090901-vei/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous-20090901-wez/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
anonymous-20090901-xxn/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20090901-yfo/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20090902-aad/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous-20090902-aku/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20090902-hct/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous-20090902-pfo/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0250 THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0253 TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
anonymous-20090903-nvu/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20090905-edk/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20090905-nif/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20090906-hdk/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20090906-ymr/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20090908-gfl/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20090909-ngd/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous-20090913-ujd/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20090913-ywf/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0093 CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous-20090914-fee/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20090916-vfk/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous-20090917-aiu/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20090917-bvk/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous-20090917-dcv/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous-20090917-dgm/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20090917-fjn/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous-20090917-frf/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0404 ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20090917-lvy/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous-20090917-mmc/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous-20090917-mvg/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous-20090917-ppu/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous-20090917-puz/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER

anonymous-20090917-sda/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED

anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous-20090917-tgz/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous-20090917-vwy/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE

anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous-20090917-xwg/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20090917-zsc/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous-20090917-ztw/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0241 WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous-20090918-wqs/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous-20090919-ape/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous-20090919-dez/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous-20090919-kma/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20090919-kwi/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
anonymous-20090919-mtv/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous-20090919-xjn/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous-20090923-ntq/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous-20090925-hko/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20090927-gzu/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20090927-ovr/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20090927-soe/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20090929-biw/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
anonymous-20091001-auy/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous-20091002-lzw/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous-20091003-ips/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20091003-thg/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous-20091005-feq/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20091007-vwg/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous-20091008-klx/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous-20091009-ijw/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20091009-jnj/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous-20091013-icf/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20091017-jrw/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20091019-cbh/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20091019-gcv/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous-20091019-hpu/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous-20091019-inx/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous-20091019-lxq/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous-20091019-mge/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20091019-nlw/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20091019-pqp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous-20091019-rbj/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous-20091019-ree/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous-20091020-cit/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous-20091020-jeh/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous-20091020-uga/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0535 DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0537 AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous-20091020-xgb/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20091020-yow/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous-20091025-sap/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20091027-coy/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20091029-hzj/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous-20091029-jdm/wav/a0314 THUS
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0203 SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0206 SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20091029-vql/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20091030-jmb/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20091101-qcf/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous-20091102-kue/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous-20091102-lwb/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20091102-qlq/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous-20091102-zha/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
anonymous-20091103-gpw/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous-20091103-lwl/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous-20091103-nvh/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20091105-jvb/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous-20091105-vgd/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous-20091107-bzq/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous-20091107-stt/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous-20091108-zco/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous-20091110-egt/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous-20091115-aat/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous-20091117-gmx/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous-20091120-evi/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0029 WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0031 THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0035 AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous-20091122-hhm/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20091122-vjb/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
anonymous-20091125-yll/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous-20091129-jmu/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
anonymous-20091203-est/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20091204-akz/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous-20091204-fqu/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
anonymous-20091204-ndj/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous-20091207-wce/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous-20091208-ijp/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous-20091208-rwz/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous-20091209-akg/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous-20091209-hpc/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous-20091209-syp/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous-20091213-pwc/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20091215-hbw/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous-20091215-jjn/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous-20091215-qpr/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0306 AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous-20091219-amu/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-16 THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-19 THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-20 THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-21 REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous-20091220-ijn/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous-20091220-kcz/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous-20091220-ngq/wav/b0215 GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20091220-qsv/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous-20091220-xjy/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous-20091221-fbh/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous-20091226-cqx/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20091226-euf/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous-20091226-fgl/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous-20091226-olz/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous-20091226-rsc/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous-20091226-tto/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous-20091226-vlu/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-02 THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous-20091227-sns/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous-20091229-exn/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20091230-cuj/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous-20091230-xjy/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0266 PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous-20091231-bfi/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous-20100103-epc/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous-20100105-yhn/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous-20100106-btd/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20100106-eyq/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
anonymous-20100106-jij/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous-20100106-kwb/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI

anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE

anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous-20100106-msc/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous-20100106-myn/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL

anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous-20100106-riw/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU

anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous-20100106-vhm/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous-20100106-vyf/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous-20100106-xmf/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous-20100106-xov/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM

anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous-20100108-eee/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous-20100109-jkc/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
anonymous-20100109-jkc/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous-20100109-jkc/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous-20100109-jkc/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS

anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
anonymous-20100109-nzr/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous-20100109-wog/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous-20100109-yqt/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous-20100110-bvj/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous-20100110-obx/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous-20100111-bxh/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous-20100111-mre/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous-20100111-rhu/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous-20100119-mmo/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous-20100121-qfq/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous-20100121-upe/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anthonyschaller-20071221-/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
Ara-20091020-vni/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
Ara-20091021-wpl/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
argail-20090722-gau/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
asp-20091228-inn/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
asp-20091228-qtl/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
atamur-20090211-wdo/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
atterer-20080101-bud/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
atterer-20080101-gpr/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
atterer-20080101-qvo/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
atterer-20080101-xkv/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
atterer-20080102-qgo/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
atterer-20080108-dlc/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
atterer-20080108-wnr/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
atterer-01202007-a/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-01 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-02 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-03 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-04 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-05 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-06 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-07 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-08 YOU WERE ENGAGED
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-09 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-10 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-11 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-12 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-13 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-14 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-15 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-16 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-17 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-18 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-19 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-20 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-21 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-22 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-23 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-24 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-25 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-26 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-27 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-28 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-29 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-30 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-31 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-32 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-33 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-34 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-35 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-36 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-37 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-38 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-39 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
atterer-01202007-b/wav/vf21-40 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-01 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-02 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-03 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-04 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-05 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-06 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-07 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-08 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-09 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
atterer-02052007-vf5/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-01 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-02 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-03 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-04 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-05 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-06 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-07 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-08 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-09 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-10 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-11 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-12 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-13 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-14 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-15 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-16 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-17 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-18 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-19 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-20 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-21 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-22 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-23 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-24 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-25 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-26 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-27 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-28 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-29 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-30 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-31 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-32 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-33 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-34 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-35 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-36 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-37 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-38 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-39 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
atterer-21012007-vf22/wav/vf22-40 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
granthulbert-ar-01032007/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
granthulbert-cc-01032007/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS

granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE

granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY

granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
granthulbert-rp-01032007/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-01 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-02 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-03 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-04 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-05 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-09 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-10 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-11 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-12 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-18 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-19 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-20 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-21 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-22 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-25 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-27 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW

jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-29 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-31 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-36 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
jaiger-20061231-vf7/wav/vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-01 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-02 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-03 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-04 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-05 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-06 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-07 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-08 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-09 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-10 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-11 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-12 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-13 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-14 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-15 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-16 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-17 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-18 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-19 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-20 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-21 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-22 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-23 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-24 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-25 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-26 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-27 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-28 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-29 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-30 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-31 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-32 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-33 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-34 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-35 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-36 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-37 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-38 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-39 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
jaiger-20061231-vf8/wav/vf8-40 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-01 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-02 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-03 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-04 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-05 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-06 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-07 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-08 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-09 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
jaiger-20070103-vf10/wav/vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-01 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-02 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-03 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-04 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-05 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-06 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-07 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-08 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES

jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-10 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-11 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-12 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-13 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-14 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-15 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-16 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-17 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-18 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-19 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-20 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS

jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-27 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-28 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-29 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-30 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-31 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-33 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-34 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-35 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-36 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-37 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-38 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-39 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
jaiger-20070103-vf9/wav/vf9-40 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-01 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-02 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-03 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-04 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-05 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-06 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-07 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-08 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-09 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-10 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-11 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-12 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-13 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-14 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-15 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-16 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-17 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-18 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-19 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-20 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY

jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-22 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-23 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-24 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-25 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-26 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-27 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-28 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-29 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-30 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-31 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-32 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-33 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-34 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-35 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
jaiger-20070209-vf11/wav/vf11-36 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE

jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-04 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT

jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-20 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-21 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
jaiger-20070209-vf12/wav/vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-01 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-02 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-03 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-04 NO-SIR-EE
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-05 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-06 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
jaiger-20070209-vf13/wav/vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE

jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK

jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
jaiger-20070209-vf14/wav/vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-01 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION

jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-22 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-23 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-24 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-25 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-26 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-27 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-28 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-29 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-30 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-31 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-32 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-33 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-34 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-35 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-36 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-37 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
jaiger-20070209-vf15/wav/vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-05 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-06 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-07 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-08 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
jaiger-vf16-20070214/wav/vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
jaiger-vf17-20070214/wav/vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-16 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-17 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-18 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-19 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-20 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-21 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-22 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-23 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-24 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-25 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-26 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-27 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-28 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-29 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-30 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-31 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-32 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-33 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-34 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-35 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-36 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-37 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-38 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-39 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
jaiger-vf18-20070214/wav/vf18-40 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-14 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-35 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-36 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
jaiger-vf19-20070220/wav/vf19-37 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-03 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-04 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-05 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-06 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-07 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-08 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-09 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-10 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-11 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-12 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
jaiger-vf20-20070220/wav/vf20-13 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE

jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0205 TO THE STUPOR WHICH OFTEN PRECEDES DEATH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0206 BUT THERE WERE IN THE PALACE A FEW PERSONS WHO KNEW BETTER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0207 CHARLES HAD NEVER BEEN A SINCERE MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0208 HIS MIND HAD LONG OSCILLATED BETWEEN HOBBISM AND POPERY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0209 WHEN HIS HEALTH WAS GOOD AND HIS SPIRITS HIGH HE WAS A SCOFFER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0210 IN HIS FEW SERIOUS MOMENTS HE WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC THE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0211 DUKE OF YORK WAS AWARE OF THIS BUT WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0212 WITH THE CARE OF HIS OWN INTERESTS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0213 HE HAD ORDERED THE OUTPORTS TO BE CLOSED HE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0214 HAD POSTED DETACHMENTS OF THE GUARDS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY HE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0215 HAD ALSO PROCURED THE FEEBLE SIGNATURE OF THE DYING KING
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0216 TO AN INSTRUMENT BY WHICH SOME DUTIES
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0217 GRANTED ONLY TILL THE DEMISE OF THE CROWN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0218 WERE LET TO FARM FOR A TERM OF THREE YEARS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0219 THESE THINGS OCCUPIED THE ATTENTION OF JAMES TO SUCH A DEGREE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0220 THAT THOUGH ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS HE WAS INDISCREETLY AND UNSEASONABLY EAGER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0221 TO BRING OVER PROSELYTES TO HIS CHURCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0222 HE NEVER REFLECTED THAT HIS BROTHER WAS IN DANGER OF DYING
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0223 WITHOUT THE LAST SACRAMENTS THIS NEGLECT WAS THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0224 BECAUSE THE DUCHESS OF YORK HAD AT THE REQUEST OF THE QUEEN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0225 SUGGESTED ON THE MORNING ON WHICH THE KING WAS TAKEN ILL
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0226 THE PROPRIETY OF PROCURING SPIRITUAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0227 CHARLES WAS AT LAST INDEBTED TO AN AGENCY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0228 OF HIS PIOUS WIFE AND SISTER-IN-LAW A LIFE OF FRIVOLTY AND VICE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0229 HAD NOT EXTINGUISHED IN THE DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH ALL SENTIMENTS OF RELIGION
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0230 OR ALL THAT KINDNESS WHICH IS THE GLORY OF HER SEX
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0231 THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR BARILLON WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0232 TO ENQUIRE AFTER THE KING PAID HER A VISIT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0233 HE FOUND HER IN AN AGONY OF SORROW
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0234 SHE TOOK HIM INTO A SECRET ROOM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe/wav/hoe0235 AND POURED OUT HER WHOLE HEART TO HIM
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-02 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-03 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-04 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-05 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-06 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-07 HOW MUCH WAS IT
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-08 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-09 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-16 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-21 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-22 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-23 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-24 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-25 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-26 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-27 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-28 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-29 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-30 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-31 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-32 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-33 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-34 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-35 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-36 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-37 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-38 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-39 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
kmaclean-12062006-a/wav/vf6-40 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
kmaclean-12062006/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-01 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-02 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-03 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-04 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-05 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-06 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-07 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-08 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-09 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
robin-20030302-vf10/wav/vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
robin-20070201/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
robin-20070201/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
robin-20070201/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
robin-20070201/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
robin-20070201/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
robin-20070201/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
robin-20070201/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
robin-20070201/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
robin-20070201/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
robin-20070201/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
robin-20070201/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
robin-20070201/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
robin-20070201/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
robin-20070201/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
robin-20070201/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
robin-20070201/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
robin-20070201/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
robin-20070201/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
robin-20070201/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
robin-20070201/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
robin-20070201/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
robin-20070201/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
robin-20070201/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
robin-20070201/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
robin-20070201/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
robin-20070201/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
robin-20070201/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
robin-20070201/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
robin-20070201/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
robin-20070201/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
robin-20070201/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
robin-20070201/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
robin-20070201/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
robin-20070201/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

robin-20070212/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
robin-20070212/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
robin-20070212/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
robin-20070212/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
robin-20070212/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
robin-20070212/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
robin-20070212/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
robin-20070212/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
robin-20070212/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
robin-20070212/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
robin-20070212/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
robin-20070212/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
robin-20070212/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
robin-20070212/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
robin-20070212/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
robin-20070212/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY

robin-20070212/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
robin-20070212/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
robin-20070212/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-01 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-02 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE

robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-08 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-09 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-10 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
robin-20070212-vf1/wav/vf1-40 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-01 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-02 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-03 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-04 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-05 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-06 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-07 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-08 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-09 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-10 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-11 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-12 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-13 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-14 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-15 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-16 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-17 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-18 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-19 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-20 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-21 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-22 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-23 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-24 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-25 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-26 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-27 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-28 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-29 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-30 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-31 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-32 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-33 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-34 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-35 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-36 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-37 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-38 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-39 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
robin-20070212-vf2/wav/vf2-40 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-01 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-03 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-07 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-09 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
robin-20070217-vf3/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-01 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-02 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-03 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-04 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-05 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-08 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
robin-20070224-vf4/wav/vf04-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-01 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-02 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-03 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-04 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-05 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-06 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-07 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-08 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-09 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
robin-20070224-vf5/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-02 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-03 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-04 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-05 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-06 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-07 HOW MUCH WAS IT
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-08 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-09 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-16 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
robin-20070224-vf6/wav/vf6-21 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-20 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-21 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-22 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-23 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-24 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-25 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS

robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-27 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-28 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-29 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
robin-20070301-vf8/wav/vf8-30 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY

robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-03 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-04 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-05 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-06 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-07 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-08 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-09 AH INDEED
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-10 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-11 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-12 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-13 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-14 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-15 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-16 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET

robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-27 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-28 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-29 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS

robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-36 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-37 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-38 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-39 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
robin-20070301-vf9/wav/vf9-40 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-01 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-02 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-03 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL

robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-08 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-09 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-10 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-11 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-12 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
robin-20070302-vf11/wav/vf11-13 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES

robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-15 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
robin-20070310-vf13/wav/vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-22 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-28 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-30 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-31 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE

robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-37 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
robin-20070326-vf14/wav/vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-01 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-02 WHAT THE FLAMING

robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-24 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-25 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-26 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-27 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-28 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-29 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-30 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-31 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-32 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-36 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-37 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
robin-20070326-vf15/wav/vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-06 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-07 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-08 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
robin-20070330-vf16/wav/vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
robin-20070330-vf17/wav/vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-16 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP

robin-20070401-vf18/wav/vf18-21 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES

robin-20070401-vf19/wav/vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR

trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-09 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST

trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
trevarthan-070403-vf3/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE

audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
audioodyssey-20081109-rew/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO

B-20091220-vus/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
B-20091220-vus/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT

B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
B-20091220-zaq/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
B-20091221-pxt/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
B-20091223-lxu/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0584 HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
B-20091230-bvx/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0283 WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
B-20091230-umt/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
B-20091230-yjo/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
bachroxx-20080119-tuu/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP

bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
bart-20090807-ufp/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE

bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
bdutta-20090502-crj/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION

bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bdutta-20090502-uzt/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY

bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
bdutta-20090502-vrk/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
ben-20090326-cpr/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ben-20090326-hxc/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW

ben-20090326-njk/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
bencoder-20080418-iev/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
bencoder-20080418-ivd/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
benkay-20090111-ar/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
benkay-20090111-cc/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
benkay-20090111-rp/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
bennmann-20091102-apc/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
bennmann-20091102-ksm/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
bennmann-20091102-vgn/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
benob-20090314-wzw/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
bhart-20100106-djk/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
bhart-20100106-giy/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-joc/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
bhart-20100106-jot/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
bhart-20100106-kab/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
bhart-20100106-lpu/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-mal/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
bhart-20100106-pvf/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-qqz/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
bhart-20100106-rfx/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
bhart-20100106-tlh/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0582 THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
bhart-20100106-wrw/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
bhart-20100106-yty/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
bhart-20100108-dsa/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
bhart-20100108-hch/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
bhart-20100108-nrx/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
bhart-20100108-uhg/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
bhart-20100108-xpl/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
bhart-20100108-yqc/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
bhavanikrishna-20100108-kth/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
bhuvan-20091111-cil/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
BigMick-20090919-pvv/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
Bitbrit-20090528-fsw/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM

Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED

Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
Blackdrive-20080605-vwx/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
bloomtom-20080612-mvm/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
bloomtom-20080612-pfg/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
bloomtom-20080612-stx/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY

BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
BlueB-20090727-ckj/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
BlueB-20090727-poc/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0001 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0002 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF LIGHT WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0003 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0004 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0005 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0006 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0007 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0008 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0009 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATIONS TO THE HEBREWS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0010 IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0011 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0012 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0013 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0014 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0015 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0016 BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0017 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0018 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0019 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER IMPOSITION
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0020 OF A NUMBER OF BOWS IF THE RED
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0021 OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0022 RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH A ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0023 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0024 THIS IS NOT THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq/wav/rai0025 ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
bluepeppers-20091030-kqs/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
bluepeppers-20091101-tyt/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
bluepeppers-20091102-nkj/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
Bob-20100106-mwu/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bonzer-20090919-btg/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
bonzer-20090919-ccj/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
bonzer-20090919-cox/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION

bonzer-20090919-otm/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
bonzer-20090919-otm/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL

bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK

bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
bonzer-20090919-oxm/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY

bonzer-20090919-qbf/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM

bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
bonzer-20090919-qcx/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
bonzer-20090919-rxe/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
bonzer-20090919-sdp/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
bonzer-20090919-uda/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMEN
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
bonzer-20090919-uin/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
bonzer-20090919-ukz/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
bonzer-20090919-uln/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
bonzer-20090919-uzm/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
bonzer-20090919-wgk/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
bonzer-20090919-yes/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
bonzer-20090919-ztf/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
bonzer-20090919-zyn/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
brad-20081015-xdf/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0020 NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
brad-20091127-cwk/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
Bradders-20080630-bli/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
Bradders-20080630-cqm/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0223 I AM ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0227 WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
Bradders-20080630-kja/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
Bradders-20080701-yvh/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
brdmb-20080603-mbr/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
brdmb-20080603-pas/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES

brdmb-20080603-pas/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
brdmb-20080603-pas/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
brdmb-20080603-pas/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
brdmb-20080603-pas/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
brdmb-20080603-uhv/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
brdmb-20080603-zvi/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
brdmb-20080721-cwt/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT

brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
brdmb-20080721-zhn/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT

Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
Brittishenglishscottish20yomale-20091005-nty/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
BruceCouper-20080305-owt/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
BruceCouper-20080305-qcd/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
BruceCouper-20080305-yre/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
btr-20090830-jgd/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF

btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
btr-20090830-msm/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE

btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
btr-20090830-utt/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI

bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE

bugsysservant-20091103-bwz/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU

bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS

bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
bugsysservant-20091103-dro/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION

bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
bugsysservant-20091103-emm/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
bugsysservant-20091103-fic/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
bugsysservant-20091103-mun/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION

bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE

bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND

bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS

bugsysservant-20091104-kan/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
bugsysservant-20091104-kan/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM

bugsysservant-20091104-rit/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
bugsysservant-20091104-rit/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP

Campbell-20100104-ldz/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
Campbell-20100104-ldz/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
Campbell-20100104-ldz/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
Campbell-20100104-ldz/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER

CarlFK-20080617-tus/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
CarlFK-20080617-tus/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
CarlFK-20080617-tus/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
ccr1-20091230-ikf/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM

ccr-20091230-uax/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

cebidae-20080522-npq/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES

cebidae-20080522-nsi/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
CezarBocu-20090218-frk/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
chainz-20090527-yik/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
Chandri-20090902-rpp/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
Chas-20100107-yfs/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING

chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0025 NOT EVEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BALLROOM IN THE WORLD
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0026 DECORATED LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0027 COULD IN ITSELF SUGGEST A BRILLIANT ENTERTAINMENT IF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO FILLED IT WERE FRUMPS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0028 OR WORSE YET VULGARIANS RATHER BE FRUMPY THAN VULGAR MUCH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0029 FRUMPS ARE OFTEN CELEBRITIES IN DISGUISE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0030 BUT A PERSON OF VULGAR APPEARANCE IS VULGAR ALL THROUGH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0031 THE SHEEP FRUMPS ARE NOT VERY TYPICAL OF AMERICA
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0032 VULGARIANS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE NUMEROUS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0033 BUT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ALL ARE THE QUIETLY DRESSED UNNOTICEABLE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE REPRESENTATIVE BACKBONE IN EVERY CITY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0034 WHO BUY GOOD CLOTHES BUT NOT MORE THAN THEY NEED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0035 AND WHOSE AMBITION IS MERELY TO BE WELL ENOUGH DRESSED TO FIT IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0036 WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE LESS NUMEROUS BUT FAR MORE CONSPICUOUS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0037 ARE THE DRESSED TO THE MINUTE WOMEN WHO
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0038 LIKE SHEEP EXACTLY FOLLOW EVERY TURN OF LATEST FASHION BLINDLY AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SENSE OF DISTANCE OR DIRECTION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0039 AS EACH NEW SEASON'S FASHION IS DEFINED ALL THE SHEEP RUN AND DRESS THEMSELVES EACH IN A REPLICA OF THE OTHER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0040 THEIR OWN TYPES AND PERSONALITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0041 FASHION SAYS WEAR BOLSTER CASES TIED AT THE NECK AND ANKLE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0042 OR A FEW WISPS OF GAUZE HELD IN PLACE WITH COURT PLASTER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0043 AND DAUGHTER MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS WEAR THE SAME
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0044 IF EMERALD GREEN IS THE FASHIONABLE COLOR ALL OF THE YELLOWEST SKINS WILL BE FRAMED IN IT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0045 WHEN HOBBLE SKIRTS ARE THE THING THE FATTEST WABBLE ALONG LOOKING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE CHANDELIERS TIED UP IN MOSQUITO NETTING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0046 IF BALL DRESSES ARE CUT TO THE LAST LIMIT OF DARING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0047 THE AMPLE BILLOWS OF THE FAT WILL VIE BLANDLY WITH THE MARVELS OF ANATOMY EXHIBITED BY THE THIN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0048 COMFORT CONVENIENCE BECOMINGNESS ADAPTABILITY BEAUTY ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0049 FASHION IS FOLLOWED TO THE LETTER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0050 THEREFORE THEY FANCY POOR SHEEP THEY ARE THE LAST WORD IN SMARTNESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0051 THOSE WHOM THE FASHION SUITS ARE SMART
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0052 BUT THEY ARE SELDOM IF EVER DISTINGUISHED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL PRECISELY ALIKE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0053 THE WOMAN WHO IS REALLY CHIC
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0054 THE WOMAN WHO IS CHIC IS ALWAYS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0055 NOT DIFFERENT IN BEING BEHIND FASHION BUT ALWAYS SLIGHTLY APART FROM IT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0056 CHIC IS A BORROWED ADJECTIVE BUT THERE IS NO ENGLISH WORD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ELEGANT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0057 WHICH WAS DESTROYED UTTERLY BY THE REPORTER OR PRACTICAL JOKER WHO SAID ELEGANT DRESSES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0058 AND YET THERE IS NO SYNONYM THAT WILL EXPRESS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF BEAUTIFUL TASTE COMBINED WITH PERSONAL DIGNITY AND GRACE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0059 WHICH GIVES TO A PERFECT COSTUME AN INIMITABLE AIR OF DISTINCTION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0060 UNE DAME ELEGANTE IS ALL OF THAT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0061 AND MRS OLDNAME IS JUST SUCH A PERSON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0062 SHE FOLLOWS FASHION MERELY SO FAR AS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0063 SHE GETS THE LATEST MODEL PERHAPS BUT HAS IT ADAPTED TO HER OWN TYPE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0064 SO THAT SHE HAS JUST THAT DISTINCTION OF APPEARANCE THAT THE SHEEP LACK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0065 SHE HAS EVEN CLUNG WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS TO THE WORTH BALL DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0066 AND HER WRAPPED OR FITTED BODICE HAS CONTINUED TO LOOK THE SMARTEST IN EVERY BALLROOM
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0067 IN SPITE OF THE GREEK DRAPERY AND ONE PIECE MEAL BAG AND ALL THE OTHER KALEIDOSCOPIC CHANGES OF FASHION THE REST OF US HAVE BEEN THROUGH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0068 BUT THE AVERAGE WOULD BE INDEPENDENT WHO DETERMINES TO STAND HER GROUND SAYING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0069 THESE NEW MODELS ARE PREPOSTEROUS I SHALL WEAR NOTHING OF THE SORT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0070 AND KEEPS HER WORD
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0071 SOON FINDS HERSELF NOT AT ALL AN EXAMPLE OF DIGNITY BUT AN OBJECT OF DERISION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0072 FASHION HAS LITTLE IN COMMON WITH BEAUTY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0073 FASHION OUGHT TO BE LIKENED TO A TIDE OR EPIDEMIC
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0074 SOMETIMES ONE MIGHT DEFINE IT AS A SORT OF HYPNOTISM SEEMINGLY EXERTED BY THE GODS AS A JOKE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0075 FASHION HAS THE POWER TO APPEAR TEMPORARILY IN THE GUISE OF BEAUTY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0076 THOUGH IT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF BEAUTY NEARLY ALWAYS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0077 IF YOU DOUBT IT LOOK AT OLD FASHION PLATES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0078 EVEN THE WOMAN OF BEAUTIFUL TASTE SUCCUMBS OCCASIONALLY TO THE EPIDEMICS OF FASHION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0079 BUT SHE IS MORE IMMUNE THAN MOST
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0080 ALL WOMEN WHO HAVE ANY CLOTHES SENSE WHATEVER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0081 KNOW MORE OR LESS THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT ARE THEIR STYLE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0082 UNLESS THEY HAVE SUCH AN ATTACK OF FASHIONITIS AS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLY DELIRIOUS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0083 TO DESCRIBE ANY DETAILS OF DRESS THAT WILL NOT BE AS QUEER TO MORROW AS TO DAY'S FASHIONS ARE BOUND TO BE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0084 WOULD SEEM AT THE OUTSET PRETTY MUCH LIKE WRITING ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S WEATHER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0085 AND YET THERE IS ONE UNCHANGING PRINCIPLE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED BY EVERY WOMAN MAN AND CHILD THAT IS WELL DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0086 SUITABILITY NOR DOES SUITABILITY MEAN MERELY THAT YOU MUST CHOOSE CLOTHES SUITABLE TO YOUR AGE AND APPEARANCE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0087 AND THAT YOU MUST GET A BALL DRESS FOR A BALL AND A STREET DRESS TO WALK IN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0088 IT MEANS EQUALLY THAT YOU MUST NOT BUY CLOTHES OUT OF PROPORTION TO YOUR INCOME OR OUT OF KEEPING WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0089 DISPROPORTIONATE EXPENDITURE IN BAD TASTE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0090 ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE EXTRAVAGANCE IN WOMEN'S DRESS REACHED SUCH A HIGH WATER MARK THAT IT WAS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR A NEW YORK WOMAN TO SPEND A THIRD OF HER HUSBAND'S INCOME ON CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0091 ALL WOMEN OF FASHION BOUGHT CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0092 WHEN IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO THEM TO BUY FURNITURE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0093 WHEN IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED PREPOSTEROUS TO BUY A PIECE OF JEWELRY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0094 BUT CLOTHES CLOTHES AND MORE CLOTHES EACH MORE HAND EMBROIDERED THAN THE LAST
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0095 UNTIL JUST AS IT SEEMED THAT NO DRESS WAS FIT TO BE SEEN IF IT HADN'T A MONTH OR TWO OF SOME ONE'S TIME EMBROIDERED ON IT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0096 THE WORK ON CLOTHES SUBSIDED UNTIL NOW WE ARE AT THE OTHER EXTREME
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0097 NO WORK IS PUT ON THEM AT ALL
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0098 AT LEAST CLOTHES TO DAY ARE MUCH MORE SENSIBLE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0099 AND LET US HOPE THE SENSE WILL BE LASTING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0100 THE WAR DID AT LEAST MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT LUXURIES AND TRIMMINGS COULD GO TOO FAR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0101 TEN YEARS AGO THE AMERICAN WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0102 WHO WALKED WHEN SHE WENT OUT OR TOOK THE STREET CAR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0103 WORE THE SAME CLOTHES EXACTLY THAT MRS GILDING WORE IN HER VICTORIA
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0104 OR TRAILED OVER A MING RUG THE FRENCH WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0105 THE AMERICAN WOMAN OF TASTE IS NOW
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0106 TOO GREAT AN ARTIST TO SIT IN A LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS COTTON PRINT SLIP COVERS MUSLIN CURTAINS AND GERANIUM POTS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE IN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0107 ANYTHING STRIKINGLY ELABORATE AND EXPENSIVE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0108 CHARMING AS HER DRESS MAY BE IN LINE AND CUT AND COLOR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0109 SHE KEEPS IT NO MATTER HOW INTRINSICALLY GOOD IT MAY BE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0110 IN HARMONY WITH HER GERANIUM POTS AND HER CHINTZ
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0111 ON THE OTHER HAND CLOTHES THAT ARE TOO PLAIN CAN BE EQUALLY OUT OF PROPORTION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0112 LAST WINTER FOR INSTANCE A COMMITTEE OF LADIES MET IN WHAT MIGHT SAFELY BE CALLED THE HANDSOMEST HOUSE IN NEW YORK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0113 IN A ROOM THAT WOULD FIT PERFECTLY IN THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0114 FILLED WITH TREASURES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE WALLACE COLLECTION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0115 THE HOSTESS PRESIDED IN A BLACK SERGE GOLF SKIRT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0116 A BUSINESS WOMAN'S WHITE SHIRT WAIST AND STOUT WALKING BOOTS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0117 HER HAIR BRUSHED FLAT AND TIDILY BACK AND FASTENED AS THOUGH FOR RIDING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0118 HER FACE AND HANDS REDOLENT OF SOAP NO POWDER NOT A NAIL MANICURED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0119 HAD SHE BEEN A GIRL EARNING HER LIVING SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SUITABLY DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0120 BUT HER MILLIONS AND HER PALACE BACKGROUND DEMAND THAT HER CLOTHES BE AT LEAST MODERATELY IN KEEPING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0121 ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DOWDY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BEING TOO RICHLY DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0122 AND TO DEFINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLOTHES THAT ARE NOTABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTINCTION AND SMARTNESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0123 AND CLOTHES THAT ARE MERELY CONSPICUOUS AND THEREFORE VULGAR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0124 IS A VERY ELUSIVE POINT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0125 HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES THAT SEEM PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0126 VULGAR CLOTHES VULGAR CLOTHES ARE THOSE WHICH NO MATTER WHAT THE FASHION OF THE MOMENT MAY BE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0127 ARE ALWAYS TOO ELABORATE FOR THE OCCASION TOO EXAGGERATED IN STYLE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0128 OR HAVE ACCESSORIES OUT OF PROPORTION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0129 PEOPLE OF UNCULTIVATED TASTE ARE APT TO FANCY DISTORTIONS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0130 TO EXAGGERATE RATHER THAN MODIFY THE PREVAILING FASHIONS FOR EXAMPLE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0131 A CONSPICUOUS EVIDENCE OF BAD STYLE THAT HAS PERSISTED THROUGH NUMBERLESS CHANGES IN FASHION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0132 IS THE OVER DRESSED AND OVER TRIMMED HEAD
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0133 THE WOMAN OF UNCULTIVATED TASTE HAS NO MORE SENSE OF MODERATION THAN THE QUEEN OF THE CANNIBALS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0134 SHE WILL ELABORATE HER HAIR DRESSING TO START WITH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0135 THIS IS ALL RIGHT IF ELABORATION REALLY SUITS HER TYPE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0136 AND THEN SHE WILL DECORATE IT WITH EVERYTHING IN THE WAY OF MILLINERY AND JEWELRY THAT SHE CAN LAY HER HANDS ON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0137 OR IN THE DAYTIME SHE FANCIES EQUALLY OVER WEIGHTED HATS AND RICH LOOKING FUR COATS AND THE LATEST EDITION IN THE MOST CONSPICUOUS POSSIBLE FOOTWEAR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0138 AND SHE MUCH PREFERS WEARING RINGS TO GLOVES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0139 MAYBE SHE THINKS THEY DO NOT GO TOGETHER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0140 SHE DESPISES SENSIBLE CLOTHING SHE ALSO DESPISES PLAIN FABRICS AND UNTRIMMED MODELS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0141 SHE ALSO CARES LITTLE APPARENTLY FOR STAYING AT HOME SINCE SHE IS PERPETUALLY SEEN AT RESTAURANTS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0142 AND AT EVERY PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT THE FOOD SHE ORDERS IS RICH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0143 THE APPEARANCE SHE MAKES IS RICH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0144 IN FACT TO SEE HER OFTEN IS LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS BEING FORCED TO EAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF BUTTER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0145 PLAIN BEAU BRUMMEL'S REMARK THAT WHEN ONE ATTRACTED TOO MUCH NOTICE ONE COULD BE SURE OF BEING NOT WELL DRESSED BUT OVER DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0146 HAS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS BEEN THE COMFORT OF THE DOWDY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0147 IT IS OF COURSE VERY OFTEN TRUE BUT NOT INVARIABLY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0148 A PERSON MAY BE STARED AT FOR ANY ONE OF MANY REASONS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0149 IT DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THE STARE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0150 A WOMAN MAY BE STARED AT BECAUSE SHE IS INDISCREET
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0151 OR BECAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE A LEFT OVER MEMBER OF THE CIRCUS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0152 OR BECAUSE SHE IS ENCHANTING TO LOOK AT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0153 IF YOU ARE MUCH STARED AT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0154 WHAT SORT OF A STARE DO YOU USUALLY MEET
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0155 IS IT BOLD OR MOCKING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0156 OR IS IT MERELY THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU WISTFULLY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0157 IF THE FIRST CHANGE YOUR MANNER IF THE SECOND WEAR MORE CONVENTIONAL CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0158 IF THE THIRD YOU MAY BE LEFT AS YOU ARE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0159 BUT BE SURE OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF THIS LAST
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0160 EXTRAVAGANCE NOT VULGARITY OSTENTATION IS ALWAYS VULGAR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0161 BUT EXTRAVAGANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY VULGAR NOT BY ANY MEANS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0162 EXTRAVAGANCE CAN BECOME DISHONEST IF CARRIED BEYOND ONE'S INCOME
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0163 NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL OR VALUABLE IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE FOR MOST OF US
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0164 ALWAYS TO WEAR NEW GLOVES IS AN EXTRAVAGANT ITEM FOR ONE WITH A SMALL ALLOWANCE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0165 BUT SCARCELY VULGAR A LAUNDRY BILL CAN BE EXTRAVAGANT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0166 FLOWERS IN ONE'S CITY HOUSE A PIECE OF BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE A GOOD TAPESTRY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0167 EACH IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE TO AN INCOME THAT CAN NOT EASILY AFFORD THE EXPENDITURE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0168 TO ONE SUFFICIENT TO BUY THE TAPESTRY THE FLOWERS ARE NOT AN EXTRAVAGANCE AT ALL
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0169 TO BUY QUANTITIES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT EVEN USED AFTER THEY ARE BOUGHT IS SHEER WASTEFULNESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0170 AND TO BUY EVERYTHING THAT TEMPTS YOU WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT OR NOT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0171 IS IF YOU CAN NOT AFFORD IT VERGING ON THE ACTUALLY DISHONEST
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0172 DRESSES FOR DINNERS AND BALLS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0173 SUPPOSING SINCE CLOTHES SUITABLE TO THE OCCASION ARE THE FIRST REQUISITE OF GOOD TASTE WE TAKE UP A FEW DETAILS THAT ARE APART FROM FASHION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0174 A DINNER DRESS REALLY MEANS EVERY SORT OF LOW OR HALF LOW EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0175 A FORMAL DINNER DRESS LIKE A BALL DRESS IS ALWAYS LOW NECKED AND WITHOUT SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0176 AND IS THE HANDSOMEST TYPE OF EVENING DRESS THAT THERE IS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0177 A BALL DRESS MAY BE EXQUISITE IN DETAIL BUT IT IS OFTEN MERELY EFFECTIVE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0178 THE PERFECT BALL DRESS IS ONE PURPOSELY DESIGNED WITH A SKIRT THAT IS BECOMING WHEN DANCING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0179 A LONG WRAPPED TYPE OF DRESS WOULD MAKE DIANA HERSELF LOOK LIKE A TOY MONKEY ON A STICK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0180 BUT MIGHT BE DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL AT A DINNER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0181 A DINNER DRESS DIFFERS FROM A BALL DRESS IN LITTLE EXCEPT THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNED FOR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0182 HAIR ORNAMENTS ALWAYS LOOK WELL AT A BALL BUT ARE NOT ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE UNLESS UNIVERSALLY IN FASHION ON OTHER OCCASIONS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0183 A LADY IN A BALL DRESS WITH NOTHING ADDED TO THE HEAD
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0184 LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE BEING HATLESS IN THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0185 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONTRADICTION OF THE CRITICISM OF THE VULGARIAN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0186 BUT BECAUSE A TIARA IS BEAUTIFUL AT A BALL OR A SPRAY OF FEATHERS OR A HIGH COMB OR ANOTHER ORNAMENT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0187 DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL OF THESE SHOULD BE PUT ON TOGETHER AND WORN IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0188 WHICH IS JUST WHAT THE VULGARIAN WOULD DO
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0189 WHETHER TO WEAR A HEAD DRESS HOWEVER DEPENDS NOT ALONE UPON FASHION
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0190 BUT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0191 IF THE TYPE OF HAIR ORNAMENT AT THE MOMENT IN FASHION IS BECOMING WEAR IT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0192 ESPECIALLY TO BALLS AND IN A BOX AT THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0193 BUT IF IT IS NOT BECOMING DON'T
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0194 LADIES OF FASHION BY THE WAY DO NOT HAVE THEIR HAIR ESPECIALLY DRESSED FOR FORMAL OCCASIONS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0195 EACH WEARS HER HAIR A CERTAIN WAY AND IT IS PUT UP EVERY MORNING JUST AS CAREFULLY AS FOR A BALL
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0196 THE ONLY TIME IT IS ARRANGED DIFFERENTLY IS FOR RIDING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0197 AH INFORMAL DINNER DRESS IS MERELY A MODIFIED FORMAL ONE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0198 IT IS LOW IN FRONT AND HIGH IN THE BACK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0199 WITH LONG OR ELBOW SLEEVES OR PERHAPS IT IS DUTCH NECK AND NO SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0200 WHEN TRAINS ARE IN FASHION ALL OLDER WOMEN SHOULD WEAR THEM
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0201 FASHION OR NO FASHION NO WOMAN WHO HAS PASSED FORTY LOOKS REALLY WELL IN A CUT OFF EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0202 AN EFFECT OF TRAIN HOWEVER CAN VERY ADEQUATELY BE PRODUCED WITH ANY ARRANGEMENT OR TRIMMING THAT EXTENDS UPON THE FLOOR
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0203 THE INFORMAL DINNER DRESS IS WORN TO THE THEATER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0204 THE RESTAURANT OF HIGH CLASS THE CONCERT AND THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0205 INFORMAL DINNER DRESSES ARE WORN IN THE BOXES AT THE OPERA ON ORDINARY NIGHTS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0206 SUCH AS WHEN NO ESPECIALLY GREAT STAR IS TO SING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0207 AND WHEN ONE IS NOT GOING ON TO A BALL AFTERWARD
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0208 BUT A BALL DRESS IS NEVER INAPPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY WITHOUT HEAD DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0209 ON GALA NIGHTS BALL DRESSES ARE WORN IN THE BOXES AND HEAD DRESSES AND AS MANY JEWELS AS ONE CHOOSES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0210 OR HAS THE TEA GOWN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0211 EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT A TEA GOWN IS A HYBRID BETWEEN A WRAPPER AND A BALL DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0212 IT HAS ALWAYS A TRAIN AND USUALLY LONG FLOWING SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0213 IS MADE OF RATHER GORGEOUS MATERIALS AND GOES ON EASILY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0214 AND ITS CHIEF USE IS NOT FOR WEAR AT THE TEA TABLE SO MUCH AS FOR DINNER ALONE WITH ONE'S FAMILY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0215 IT CAN HOWEVER VERY PROPERLY BE PUT ON FOR TEA
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0216 AND IF ONE IS DINING AT HOME KEPT ON FOR DINNER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0217 OTHERWISE A LADY IS APT TO TAKE TEA IN WHATEVER DRESS SHE HAD ON FOR LUNCHEON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0218 AND DRESS AFTER TEA FOR DINNER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0219 ONE DOES NOT GO OUT TO DINE IN A TEA GOWN EXCEPT IN THE HOUSE OF A MEMBER OF ONE'S FAMILY OR A MOST INTIMATE FRIEND
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0220 ONE WOULD WEAR A TEA GOWN IN ONE'S OWN HOUSE IN RECEIVING A GUEST TO WHOSE HOUSE ONE WOULD WEAR A DINNER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0221 WHEN IN DOUBT THERE IS ONE RULE THAT IS FAIRLY SAFE TO FOLLOW
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0222 WHEN IN DOUBT WEAR THE PLAINER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0223 IT IS ALWAYS BETTER FAR TO BE UNDER DRESSED THAN OVER DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0224 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO PUT ON A BALL DRESS OR A DINNER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0225 WEAR THE DINNER DRESS OR WHETHER TO WEAR CLOTH OR BROCADE TO A LUNCHEON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0226 WEAR THE CLOTH ON THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0227 YOUR TEA GOWNS SINCE THEY ARE NEVER WORN IN PUBLIC
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0228 CAN LITERALLY BE AS BIZARRE AS YOU PLEASE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0229 AND IF YOU ARE DRIVING IN A CLOSED MOTOR YOU CAN ALSO WEAR AN ORIGINAL TYPE OF DRESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0230 BUT IN WALKING ON THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0231 IF YOU CARE TO BE TAKEN FOR A WELL BRED PERSON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0232 NEVER WEAR ANYTHING THAT IS EXAGGERATED IF SKIRTS ARE SHORT
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0233 DON'T WEAR THEM TWO INCHES SHORTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE'S
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0234 IF THEY ARE LONG DON'T GO DOWN THE STREET DRAGGING A TRAIN AND SWEEPING THE DIRT UP ON THE UNDER FLOUNCINGS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0235 LET US HOPE THAT FASHION NEVER COMES BACK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0236 DON'T WEAR TOO MUCH JEWELRY IT IS IN BAD TASTE IN THE FIRST PLACE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0237 AND IN THE SECOND IS A TEMPTATION TO A THIEF
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0238 AND DON'T UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DISTORT YOUR FIGURE INTO A GROTESQUE SHAPE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0239 COUNTRY CLOTHES NOTHING SO MARKS THE PERSON WHO DOESN'T KNOW AS INAPPROPRIATE CHOICE OF CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0240 TO WEAR ELABORATE CLOTHES OUT OF DOORS IN THE COUNTRY IS QUITE AS OUT OF PLACE AS TO PARADE SPORTS CLOTHES ON THE STREETS IN TOWN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0241 IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT SPORT CLOTHES ARE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0242 ESPECIALLY FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE ELDERLY LADIES NEEDLESS TO SAY SHOULD NOT DON SPORTING ECCENTRICITIES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0243 NOR WEAR SWEATERS TO LUNCH PARTIES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0244 BUT SENSIBLE COUNTRY CLOTHES SUCH AS HAVE FOR MANY DECADES BEEN WORN IN ENGLAND
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0245 OF HOMESPUN OR SERGE OR JERSEY CLOTH OR WHATEVER HAS REPLACED THESE MATERIALS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0246 ARE CERTAINLY MORE APPROPRIATE TO WALK IN THAN A TOWN COSTUME EVEN FOR A LADY OF SEVENTY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0247 YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO THE COUNTRY FOR THE DAY WEAR SPORTS CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0248 WHICH IF SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING IN TOWN AND AGAIN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0249 MERELY SHOW YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE COUNTRY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0250 BUT TOWN CLOTHES IN THE COUNTRY PROCLAIM YOUR IGNORANCE OF FITNESS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0251 EVEN FOR A LUNCH PARTY AT GOLDEN HALL OR GREAT ESTATES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0252 EVERY ONE WHO IS YOUNG WEARS SMART COUNTRY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0253 SHOES AND SLIPPERS SPORT SHOES ARE NATURALLY ADAPTED TO THE SPORT FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0254 HIGH HEELED SLIPPERS DO NOT GO WITH ANY COUNTRY CLOTHES EXCEPT ORGANDIE OR MUSLINS OR OTHER DISTINCTLY FEMININE SUMMER DRESSES
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0255 ELABORATE AFTERNOON DRESSES OF PAINTED CHIFFONS EMBROIDERED MULLS ETC

chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0259 OR TURNS A BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH HAWAIIAN BROWN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0260 BUT A WOMAN WHOSE CREAMY COMPLEXION BURSTS INTO FRECKLES AS VIOLENT AS THEY ARE HIDEOUS AT THE FIRST TOUCH OF THE SUN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0261 NEED NO LONGER STAY PERPETUALLY INDOORS IN DAYTIME
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0262 OR VENTURE OUT ONLY WHEN SWATHED LIKE A TURK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0263 IF SHE KNOWS THE VIRTUE IN ORANGE AS A COLOR THAT DEFIES THE SUN'S RAYS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0264 A THIN VEIL OF RED ORANGE IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A THICK ONE OF BLUE OR BLACK
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0265 ORANGE SHIRT WAISTS DO NOT SOUND VERY CONSERVATIVE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0266 BUT THEY ARE MERCIFULLY CONSERVING TO ARMS SENSITIVE TO SUNBURN
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0267 YOUNG MRS GILDING WHOSE SKIN IS AS PERISHABLE AS IT IS LOVELY
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0268 ALWAYS WEARS ORANGE ON THE GOLF COURSE

chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0272 PINNED ACROSS HER NOSE UNDER HER EYES OF ORANGE MARQUISETTE
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0273 WHICH IS EASIER TO BREATHE THROUGH THAN CHIFFON
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0274 ALLOWS HER TO PLAY GOLF OR TENNIS OR TO MOTOR OR EVEN GO OUT IN A SAILBOAT AND KEEP HER SKIN WITHOUT A BLEMISH
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0275 CONSTANCE STYLE WHO ALSO HAS A SKIN THAT THE SUN DESTROYS
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0276 WEARS ORANGE PLAYING TENNIS BUT FOR BATHING WEARS A HIGH NECK AND LONG SLEEVED BATHING SUIT

chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0279 AND FLESH COLOR ORDINARY POWDER ON TOP
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0280 THE GREASE PAINT WITHSTANDS HOT SUN AND WATER
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0281 BUT IT IS MESSY THE ALTERNATIVE HOWEVER IS A CHOICE BETWEEN COMPLEXION OR BATHING
chocoholic-20070524/wav/eti0282 AS IT IS OTHERWISE PROHIBITIVE FOR THE SUN AFFLICTED TO HAVE BOTH

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0018 OF AN OFFICER'S UNIFORM IT IS NOT WORN SO AS TO MAKE THE WEARER LOOK

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0035 TOO GREAT A LOVER OF GOOD FORM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0036 TO BE IGNORANT OF THE PROPER OUTLINE NECESSARY TO SMARTNESS OF APPEARANCE IN THE SADDLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0037 IN SMARTEST ENGLISH SOCIETY IT IS NOT CONSIDERED BEST FORM FOR A YOUNG GIRL TO RIDE ASTRIDE IN THE HUNTING FIELD

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0169 A PINK AND A GREEN AT THE MOMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0170 YOU CAN WEAR FLESH COLORED SLIPPERS AND STOCKINGS WITH EVERYTHING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0171 WHICH RATHER WEAKENS THE ARGUMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0172 HOWEVER A BLUE FAN DOES NOT LOOK WELL WITH A PINK OR A GREEN DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0173 NOR DO THE OTHER COMBINATIONS SUPPOSING HOWEVER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0174 YOU HAD INSTEAD A CREAM COLORED DRESS A FLESH COLORED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0175 AND AN ORCHID ONE FLESH COLORED SLIPPERS LOOK MUCH BETTER WITH CREAM AND ORCHID
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0176 THAN WITH EITHER GREEN OR BLUE AT ANY RATE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0177 A WATERMELON PINK FAN IS LOVELY IN NIGHT LIGHT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0178 WITH ALL THREE SO IS A CREAM ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0179 OR PERHAPS BY CHANGING BOTH FAN AND SLIPPERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0180 A DIFFERENT EFFECT IS PRODUCED SINCE THE COLORS OF YOUR CLOTHES ARE BACKGROUND COLORS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0181 BUT NOTHING REALLY CAN COMPARE WITH THE UTILITY AND SMARTNESS OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0182 BLACK TAKE A BLACK TULLE DRESS MADE IN THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE WAY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0183 WORN PLAIN IT IS A SIMPLE DINNER DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0184 IT CAN HAVE A LACE SLIP TO GO OVER IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0185 AND MAKE ANOTHER DRESS WITH A JET HARNESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0186 MEANING MERELY TRIMMING THAT CAN BE ADDED AT WILL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0187 IT IS STILL ANOTHER DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0188 OR IT CAN HAVE A TUNIC OF SILVER OR OF GOLD TRIMMING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0189 AND FANS FLOWERS AND SLIPPERS IN VARIOUS COLORS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0190 SUCH AS WATERMELON OR EMERALD CHANGE IT AGAIN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0191 IN FACT A BLACK
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0192 TULLE CAN BE CHANGED ALMOST AS EASILY AS THOUGH DONE WITH A MAGICIAN'S WAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0193 TO CHOOSE DAYTIME CLOTHES THAT GO WITH THE SAME HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0194 SHOES PARASOLS WRIST BAGS AND GLOVES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0195 A SNUFF COLORED DRESS AND A GRAY ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0196 NEED ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ACCESSORIES RUSSET SHOES CHAMOIS GLOVES AND SAND COLORED HAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0197 GO ALSO WITH HENNA RASPBERRY REDS ETC BUT GRAY MUST HAVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0198 GRAY OR WHITE SHOES GLOVES AND HAT WHICH ALSO GO WITH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0199 BLUES GREENS AND VIOLETS DON'T GET TOO MANY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0200 CHOOSE THE CLOTHES WHICH YOU MUST HAVE CAREFULLY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0201 AND IF YOU MUST CUT DOWN CUT DOWN ON ELABORATE ONES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0202 THERE IS SCARCELY ANYWHERE THAT YOU CAN NOT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0203 FITTINGLY GO IN PLAIN CLOTHES VERY FEW IF ANY PEOPLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0204 NEED FANCY THINGS ALL PEOPLE NEED PLAIN ONES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0205 A VERY BEAUTIFUL CHICAGO WOMAN WHO IS ALWAYS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0206 PERFECTLY DRESSED FOR EVERY OCCASION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0207 WORKED OUT THE COST OF HER OWN CLOTHES THIS WAY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0208 ON A SHEET OF PAPER THUMB TACKED ON THE INSIDE OF HER CLOSET DOOR
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0209 SHE PUT A COMPLETE TYPEWRITTEN LIST OF HER DRESSES AND HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0210 AND THE COST OF EACH EVERY TIME SHE PUT ON A DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0211 SHE MADE A PENCIL MARK BY AND BY WHEN A DRESS WAS DISCARDED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0212 SHE DIVIDED THE COST OF IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0213 BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES IT HAD BEEN WORN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0214 IN THIS WAY SHE FOUND OUT ACCURATELY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0215 WHICH WERE HER CHEAPEST AND WHICH HER MOST EXPENSIVE CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0216 WHEN GETTING NEW ONES SHE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0217 SINCE SHE AVOIDS THE DRESS THAT IS NEVER PUT ON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0218 WHICH IS A BIGGER HANDICAP FOR THE MEDIUM SIZED ALLOWANCE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0219 THAN MANY WOMEN REALIZE WHAT TO WEAR IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0220 RESTAURANT DRESS DEPENDS UPON THE RESTAURANT AND THE CITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0221 BECAUSE WOMEN IN NEW YORK WEAR LOW NECKED DRESSES AND NO HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0222 DOES NOT MEAN THAT THOSE WHO LIVE IN NEW TOWN SHOULD DO THE SAME
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0223 IF IT IS NOT NEW TOWN'S CUSTOM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0224 BUT YOU MUST NEVER WEAR AN EVENING DRESS AND A HAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0225 AND NEVER WEAR A DAY DRESS WITHOUT ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0226 IF IN THE CITY WHERE YOU LIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0227 PEOPLE WEAR DAY CLOTHES IN THE EVENING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0228 YOU CAN ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY DIFFER FROM THEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0229 IT IS NEVER GOOD FORM TO BE ELABORATELY DRESSED IN A PUBLIC
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0230 PLACE EXCEPT IN A BOX AT THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0231 OR AT A CHARITY BALL AT A WEDDING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0232 A GARDEN PARTY OR AFTERNOON TEA
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0233 THESE ARE THE OCCASIONS WHEN ELABORATE DAY DRESSES ARE APPROPRIATE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0234 BUT IF YOU HAVE VERY FEW CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0235 YOU CAN PERFECTLY WELL WEAR ANY SORT OF DAY DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0236 THAT MAY BE IN FASHION A COAT AND SKIRT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0237 SINCE A SKIRT AND SHIRT WAIST IS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0238 AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A UTILITY COMBINATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0239 UNLESS OF COURSE THE WAIST IS OF A COLOR TO MATCH THE SKIRT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0240 SO THAT IT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0241 YOU NEED HOWEVER SELDOM WORRY ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT AS DRESSED AS THE OTHERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0242 THE TIME TO WORRY IS WHEN YOU ARE MORE DRESSED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0243 THAN ANY ONE ELSE FOR A GARDEN PARTY A COUNTRY DRESS IS QUITE ALL RIGHT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0244 THOUGH IF YOU HAVE A VERY ELABORATE SUMMER DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0245 THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN WEAR IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0246 NO ONE HAS TO BE TOLD WHAT TO WEAR TO CHURCH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0247 IN SMALL COUNTRY CHURCHES AT THE SEASHORE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0248 PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH IN COUNTRY CLOTHES OTHERWISE AS EVERY ONE KNOWS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0249 ONE PUTS ON TOWN CLOTHES AND GLOVES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0250 AT A FORMAL LUNCHEON IN TOWN ONE SEES EVERY SORT OF DRESS FROM VELVET
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0251 TO TAILOR MADE CERTAIN LADIES OLDER ONES USUALLY WHO LIKE ELABORATE CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0252 WEAR THEM BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE USUALLY DRESSED IN WORSTED MATERIALS OR SILKS THAT ARE DULL IN FINISH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0253 AND THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE EMBROIDERED AND VERY EXPENSIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0254 GIVE AN EFFECT OF SIMPLICITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0255 ONE SHOULD ALWAYS WEAR A SIMPLER DRESS IN ONE'S OWN HOUSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0256 THAN ONE WEARS IN GOING TO THE HOUSE OF ANOTHER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0257 A FEW GENERAL REMARKS THE FAULT OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0258 BAD TASTE IS USUALLY IN OVER DRESSING QUALITY NOT EFFECT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0259 IS THE STANDARD TO SEEK FOR MACHINE MADE PASSEMENTERIE ON TOP OF CONSPICUOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0260 BUT SLEAZY MATERIAL IS ALWAYS SHODDY CUT AND FIT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0261 ARE THE TWO ITEMS OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0262 AS WELL AS IN MEN'S BUT FASHION CHANGES TOO RAPIDLY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0263 TO MAKE VALUE OF MATERIAL ALWAYS WISE EXPENDITURE FOR ONE OF SLENDER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0264 PURSE BETTER USUALLY HAVE TWO DRESSES EACH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0265 CUT AND MADE IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0266 THAN ONE WHICH MUST BE WORN AFTER THE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0267 WHIM HAS BECOME A FREAK IN MEN'S CLOTHES THE OPPOSITE RULE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0268 SINCE GOOD STYLE IN MEN'S CLOTHES IS UNCHANGING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0269 TO BUY THINGS AT SALES IS VERY MUCH LIKE BUYING THINGS AT AN AUCTION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0270 IF YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND SOMETHING ABOUT VALUES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0271 YOU CAN OFTEN DO MARVELLOUSLY WELL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0272 BUT IF YOU ARE EASILY BEWILDERED AND KNOW LITTLE OF VALUES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0273 YOU ARE APT TO SPEND YOUR GOOD MONEY ON TRASH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0274 A WOMAN OF SMALL MEANS MUST EITHER BE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0275 OR LEARN TO BE DISCRIMINATINGLY CAREFUL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0276 OR SHE WOULD BETTER HAVE HER CLOTHES MADE AT HOME
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0277 OR IF SHE IS OF MODEL TYPE BUY THEM READY MADE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0278 THE READY TO WEAR CLOTHES IN THE MISSES DEPARTMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0279 ARE GROWING EVERY YEAR BETTER LOOKING UNFORTUNATELY AND FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0280 THE USUAL WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT DOES NOT COMPARE IN GOOD TASTE IN SELECTION OF MODELS WITH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0281 THE FORMER AND IT IS UNUSUAL TO FIND A DRESS THAT A LADY OF FASHION WOULD CHOOSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0282 EXCEPT AMONG THE IMPORTED MODELS FOR WHICH STORE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0283 PRICES ARE AS A RULE HIGHER THAN THOSE ASKED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0284 BY THE GREATEST DRESSMAKERS EVENING CLOTHES ARE STILL USUALLY UNBUYABLE BY THE OVER FASTIDIOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0285 EXCEPT FOR A CERTAIN FLAPPER TYPE AND AN UNDISTINGUISHED ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0286 AT THAT AND THE ULTRA SMART WOMAN IS STILL OBLIGED TO GO TO THE PRIVATE IMPORTERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0287 FOR HER DEBUTANTE DAUGHTER'S BALL DRESSES AS WELL AS HER OWN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0288 OR ELSE INTO HER OWN SEWING ROOM FASHION AND FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0289 FOR YEARS THE THIN EVEN THE SCRAWNY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0290 HAVE HAD EVERYTHING THEIR OWN WAY THE WOMAN WHO IS FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0291 OR EVEN PLUMP HAS A RATHER HOPELESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0292 PROBLEM UNLESS FASHION GOES TO TURKEY FOR ITS NEXT INSPIRATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0293 WHICH IS SO UNLIKELY IT IS ALMOST POSSIBLE TWO THINGS THE FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0294 WOMAN SHOULD AVOID BIG PATTERNS AND THE STIFF TAILOR MADE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0295 FAT WOMEN LOOK BETTER IN FEMININE CLOTHES THAT FOLLOW IN THE WAKE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0296 NEVER IN THE ADVANCE OF MODIFIED FASHION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0297 FAT WOMEN SHOULD NEVER WEAR ELABORATE CLOTHES OR CLOTHES IN LIGHT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0298 COLORS OR HEAVILY FEATHERED HATS THE TENDENCY OF FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0299 IS TO TAKE AWAY FROM ONE'S GRACILITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0300 THEREFORE ANY ONE INCLINED TO BE FAT MUST BE ULTRA CONSERVATIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0301 IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT VERY TIGHT CLOTHES MAKE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0302 FAT PEOPLE LOOK FATTER AND THIN PEOPLE THINNER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0303 SATIN IS A BAD MATERIAL SINCE HIGH LIGHTS ARE TOO SHIMMERINGLY ACCENTUATED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0304 HEAVY ANKLES NEEDLESS TO SAY SHOULD NEVER BE CLOTHED IN LIGHT STOCKINGS AND DARK SHOES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0305 LONG POINTED SLIPPERS ACCENTUATE A THICK ANKLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0306 AND SO DOES A SHORT SKIRT THAT HAS A STRAIGHT HEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0307 A RAGGED EDGE IS MOST FLATTERING DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0308 STOCKINGS AND SLIPPERS TO MATCH ARE UNAVOIDABLE IN EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0309 BUT WHEN POSSIBLE A THICK ANKLE SHOULD HAVE A DARK STOCKING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0310 OR AT LEAST A SLIPPER TO MATCH THE STOCKING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0311 PEOPLE SHOULD SELECT COLORS THAT GO WITH THEIR SKIN AND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0312 ELDERLY WOMEN SHOULD NOT WEAR GRASS GREEN OR ROYAL BLUE OR PURPLE OR ANY HARD COLOR THAT NEEDS A FAULTLESS COMPLEXION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0313 SWARTHY SKIN ALWAYS LOOKS BETTER IN COLORS THAT HAVE RED OR YELLOW IN THEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0314 A VERY SALLOW PERSON IN PALE BLUE OR APPLE GREEN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0315 LOOKS LIKE A WELL DEVELOPED CASE OF JAUNDICE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0316 PINK AND ORCHID ARE OFTEN VERY BECOMING TO OLDER WOMEN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0317 AND PALE BLUE OR YELLOW TO THOSE WITH FAIR SKIN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0318 BECAUSE A WOMAN IS NO LONGER YOUNG IS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD WEAR PERPETUAL BLACK
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0319 UNLESS SHE IS FAT CLOTHES FOR TRAVELING IN EUROPE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0320 IDEAL TRAVELING CLOTHES ARE THOSE WHICH DO NOT WRINKLE OR SHOW RAIN SPOTS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0321 AND TO FIND WHICH THESE ARE IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A SAMPLE OF EACH MATERIAL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0322 SPRINKLE IT WITH WATER AND TWIST IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0323 TO SEE HOW MUCH ABUSE IT WILL STAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0324 EVERY WOMAN KNOWS WHAT SHE LIKES BEST AND WHAT SHE CONSIDERS SUITABLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0325 TWO ALTERNATING TRAVELING DRESSES AT LEAST WILL BE NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0326 AND TWO OR THREE SEMI EVENING DRESSES TO PUT ON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0327 FOR DINNER ONE VERY SIMPLE HALF DINNER DRESS OF BLACK
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0328 THAT HAS A COMBINATION OF TRIMMINGS SUCH AS DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THIS CHAPTER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0329 IS IDEALLY USEFUL TOURISTS DO NOT PUT ON EVENING CLOTHES EXCEPT IN VERY FASHIONABLE CENTERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0330 SUCH AS LONDON PARIS MONTE CARLO OR DEAUVILLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0331 AND THEN ONLY IF STAYING AT AN ULTRA FASHIONABLE HOTEL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0332 TO BE OVER DRESSED IS ALWAYS IN BAD TASTE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0333 SO THAT UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0334 OR MAKE SEVERAL DAY STOPS THE ONE BLACK EVENING DRESS SUGGESTED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0335 WOULD ANSWER EVERY POSSIBLE PURPOSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0336 IF YOU INTEND STAYING FOR A LONG TIME IN ONE PLACE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0337 YOU TAKE ALL OF YOUR SEASON'S CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0338 AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT IN ENGLAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0339 OR TO STAY ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY YOU WILL NEED COUNTRY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0340 BUT NOT ON ORDINARY TOURING FOR MOTORING SPACE IS PRECIOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0341 AND CLOTHES SHOULD BE CHOSEN WITH THE OBJECT OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0342 PACKING INTO SMALL DIMENSIONS MOTORING IN EUROPE IS COLD
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0343 A VERY WARM LONG WRAP IS NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0344 AN OLD FUR ONE IS MUCH THE BEST
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0345 AND A SMALL CLOSE HAT THAT DOES NOT BLOW
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0346 CLOTHES AND PARIS IT IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0347 YOU HAVE BEEN HYPNOTIZED BEFORE AND YOU VOW YOU WON'T BE AGAIN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0348 YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET A BLACK DRESS AND A DARK BLUE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0349 AND NOTHING ELSE YOU ENTER THE LOWER RECEPTION HALL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0350 AND MOUNT THE BRONZE BALUSTRADED STAIRS HALF WAY WHEN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0351 ALREADY MLLE MARIE IS AWARE OF YOUR APPROACH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0352 SHE GREETS YOU NOT ONLY AS THOUGH YOU ARE THE ONLY CUSTOMER SHE HAS EVER HAD

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0355 SHE TELLS YOU BREATHLESSLY THAT YOU ARE JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE PARADE OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0356 MODELS SHE PUTS YOU WHERE YOU MAY HAVE AN UNINTERRUPTED VIEW
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0357 SHE THEN BEGINS HER GREETINGS ALL OVER AGAIN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0358 BY ASKING NOT ALONE AFTER ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0359 AND AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG LIST OF FRIENDS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0360 BUT MAKES A SOLICITOUS INQUIRY AFTER EACH DRESS THAT SHE HAS EVER SOLD YOU
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0361 DID MADAME LIKE HER WHITE VELVET SHE COOS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0362 WAS IT NOT MOST USEFUL WAS NOT HER BLACK LACE CHARMING

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0364 CLOTH BUT YOUR EARS ARE AS STONE TO HER BLANDISHMENTS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0365 AS A TRAVELING SUIT BISQUE COLORED CLOTH HAD NOT BEEN SERVICEABLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0366 BLACK LACE WITH A CERISE VELVET UNDER PETTICOAT MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE AT ARMENONVILLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0367 BUT IT HAD SEEMED QUEER TO SAY THE LEAST AT THE TENNIS MATCH IN AUGUST
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0368 NO YOU ARE AT LAST IMMUNE FROM ANY OF THOSE SUDDEN ATTACKS OF NEW FASHION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0369 FEVER THAT RESULT IN LOSS OF JUDGMENT

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0372 TRIMMED WITH BLACK BRAID OR SATIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0376 BESIDES ZEBRA STRIPES AND GOLD SHOT WITH CERISE AND PURPLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0377 YOU THINK AN EMERALD GREEN CHARMEUSE IS REALLY A
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0378 PERFECT SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PLAIN BLACK CREPE DE CHINE YOU HAD IN MIND

chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0411 BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES OF COURSE THEY DO ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO GO EVERY YEAR
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0412 BUT THE WOMAN WHO GOES ABROAD PERHAPS EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IS APT TO BE DEFICIENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0413 IN A TRANS ATLANTIC SENSE MATCH BACKGROUNDS LIKE CHARMING LITTLE ANIMALS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0414 NEVER OH A VERY BIG NEVER AGAIN AND YET
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0415 THE NEXT TIME SHALL YOU NOT FIND IT A
chocoholic-20070612-eti33/wav/eti0416 TEMPTATION TO GO JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NEWEST ARTFULLY ENTICING LITTLE TUNE OF

chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0003 ETIQUETTE IN SOCIETY IN BUSINESS IN POLITICS AND AT HOME BY EMILY POST CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0004 THE KINDERGARTEN OF ETIQUETTE IN THE HOUSES OF THE WELL TO DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0005 WHERE THE NURSERY IS IN CHARGE OF A WOMAN OF REFINEMENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0006 WHO IS COMPETENT TO TEACH LITTLE CHILDREN PROPER BEHAVIOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0007 THEY ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO COME TO TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM UNTIL THEY HAVE LEARNED AT LEAST THE ELEMENTS OF GOOD MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0008 BUT WHETHER IN A BIG HOUSE OF THIS DESCRIPTION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0009 OR IN A SMALL HOUSE WHERE PERHAPS THE MOTHER ALONE MUST BE THE TEACHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0010 CHILDREN CAN SCARCELY BE TOO YOUNG TO BE TAUGHT THE RUDIMENTS OF ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0011 NOR CAN THE TEACHING BE TOO PATIENTLY OR TOO CONSCIENTIOUSLY CARRIED OUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0012 TRAINING A CHILD IS EXACTLY LIKE TRAINING A PUPPY A LITTLE HEEDLESS INATTENTION AND IT IS OUT IF HAND IMMEDIATELY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0013 THE GREAT THING IS NOT TO LET IT ACQUIRE BAD HABITS THAT MUST AFTERWARD BE BROKEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0014 ANY CHILD CAN BE TAUGHT TO BE BEAUTIFULLY BEHAVED WITH NO EFFORT GREATER THAN QUIET PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0015 WHEREAS TO BREAK BAD HABITS ONCE THEY ARE ACQUIRED IS A HERCULEAN TASK ELEMENTARY TABLE MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0016 SINCE A VERY LITTLE CHILD CAN NOT HOLD A SPOON PROPERLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0017 AND AS NEATNESS IS THE FIRST REQUISITE IN TABLE MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0018 IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HOLD ITS SPOON AS IT MIGHT TAKE HOLD OF A BAR IN FRONT OF IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0019 BACK OF THE HAND UP THUMB CLOSED OVER FIST THE PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0020 A SMALL FLAT PIECE OF SILVER AT RIGHT ANGLES TO A HANDLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0021 IS HELD IN THE SAME WAY IN THE LEFT HAND ALSO IN THE FIRST EATING LESSONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0022 A BABY MUST BE ALLOWED TO PUT A SPOON IN ITS MOUTH POINTED END FOREMOST
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0023 ITS FIRST LESSONS MUST BE TO TAKE SMALL MOUTHFULS TO EAT VERY SLOWLY TO SPILL NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0024 TO KEEP THE MOUTH SHUT WHILE CHEWING AND NOT SMEAR ITS FACE OVER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0025 IN DRINKING A CHILD SHOULD USE BOTH HANDS TO HOLD A MUG OR GLASS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0026 UNTIL ITS HAND IS BIG ENOUGH SO IT CAN EASILY HOLD A GLASS IN ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0027 WHEN IT CAN EAT WITHOUT SPILLING ANYTHING OR SMEARING ITS LIPS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0028 AND DRINK WITHOUT MAKING GREASE MOONS ON ITS MUG OR TUMBLER BY ALWAYS WIPING ITS MOUTH BEFORE DRINKING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0029 IT MAY BE ALLOWED TO COME TO TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM AS A TREAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0030 FOR SUNDAY LUNCH OR BREAKFAST OR IF IT HAS BEEN TAUGHT BY ITS MOTHER AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0031 SHE CAN RELAX HER ATTENTION SOMEWHAT FROM ITS PROGRESS GIRLS ARE USUALLY DAINTIER AND MORE EASILY TAUGHT THAN BOYS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0032 BUT MOST CHILDREN WILL BEHAVE BADLY AT TABLE IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0033 EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY COMMIT NO SERIOUS OFFENSES SUCH AS MAKING A MESS OF THEIR FOOD OR THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0034 OR TALKING WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL ALL CHILDREN LOVE TO CRUMB BREAD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0035 FLOP THIS WAY AND THAT IN THEIR CHAIRS KNOCK SPOONS AND FORKS TOGETHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0036 DAWDLE OVER THEIR FOOD FEED ANIMALS IF ANY ARE ALLOWED IN THE ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0037 OR BECOME RESTLESS AND NOISY ONCE GRADUATED TO THE DINING ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0038 ANY REVERSION TO SUCH TACTICS MUST BE FIRMLY REPREHENDED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0039 AND THE CHILD SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT CONTINUED OFFENSE MEANS A RETURN TO THE NURSERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0040 BUT BEFORE COMPANY IT IS BEST TO SAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0041 SINCE TOO MUCH NAGGING IN THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS LESSENS A CHILD'S INCENTIVE TO GOOD BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0042 IF IT REFUSES TO BEHAVE NICELY MUCH THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO SAY NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0043 BUT GET UP AND QUIETLY LEAD IT FROM THE TABLE BACK TO THE NURSERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0044 IT IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE CHILD BUT ANNOYING TO A GUEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0045 TO CONTINUE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0046 AND THE CHILD LEARNS MUCH MORE QUICKLY TO BE WELL BEHAVED IF IT UNDERSTANDS THAT GOOD BEHAVIOR IS THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO GROWN UP SOCIETY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0047 A WORD OR TWO SUCH AS DON'T LEAN ON THE TABLE DARLING OR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0048 PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING DEAR SHOULD SUFFICE BUT A CHILD THAT IS NOISY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0049 THAT REACHES OUT TO HELP ITSELF TO CANDY OR CAKE THAT INTERRUPTS THE CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0050 THAT EATS UNTIDILY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE NURSERY BEFORE IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY GRADUATED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0051 TABLE MANNERS MUST OF COURSE PROCEED SLOWLY IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT ANY OTHER LESSONS PROCEED IN SCHOOL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0052 HAVING LEARNED WHEN A BABY TO USE THE NURSERY IMPLEMENTS OF SPOON AND PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0053 THE CHILD WHEN IT IS A LITTLE OLDER DISCARDS THEM FOR THE FORK SPOON
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0054 AND KNIFE THE PROPER USE OF THE FORK AS SOON THEREFORE AS HIS HAND IS DEXTEROUS ENOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0055 THE CHILD MUST BE TAUGHT TO HOLD HIS FORK NO LONGER GRIPPED BABY FASHION IN HIS FIST
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0056 BUT MUCH AS A PENCIL IS HELD IN WRITING ONLY THE FINGERS ARE PLACED NEARER THE TOP
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0057 THAN THE POINT THE THUMB AND TWO FIRST FINGERS ARE CLOSED AROUND THE HANDLE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY UP THE SHANK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0058 AND THE FOOD IS TAKEN UP SHOVEL WISE ON THE TURNED UP PRONGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0059 AT FIRST HIS LITTLE FINGERS WILL HOLD HIS FORK STIFFLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0060 BUT AS HE GROWS OLDER HIS FINGERS WILL BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0061 JUST AS THEY WILL IN HOLDING HIS PENCIL IF HE FINDS IT HARD WORK TO SHOVEL HIS FOOD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0062 HE CAN FOR A WHILE CONTINUE TO USE HIS NURSERY PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0063 BY AND BY THE PUSHER IS CHANGED FOR A SMALL PIECE OF BREAD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0064 WHICH IS HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BETWEEN THUMB AND FIRST TWO FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0065 AND AGAINST WHICH THE FORK SHOVELS UP SUCH ELUSIVE ARTICLES AS CORN PEAS POACHED EGG
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0066 ETC THE SPOON IN USING THE SPOON HE HOLDS IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND LIKE THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0067 IN EATING CEREAL OR DESSERT HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO DIP THE BOWL OF THE SPOON TOWARD HIM AND EAT FROM THE END
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0068 BUT IN EATING SOUP HE MUST DIP HIS SPOON AWAY FROM HIM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0069 TURNING THE OUTER RIM OF THE BOWL DOWN AS HE DOES SO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0070 FILL THE BOWL NOT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS FULL AND SIP IT WITHOUT NOISE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0071 OUT OF THE SIDE NOT THE END OF THE BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0072 THE REASON WHY THE BOWL MUST NOT BE FILLED FULL IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIFT A BRIMMING SPOONFUL OF LIQUID TO HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0073 WITHOUT SPILLING SOME OR IN THE CASE OF PORRIDGE WITHOUT FILLING HIS MOUTH TOO FULL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0074 WHILE STILL VERY YOUNG HE MAY BE TAUGHT NEVER TO LEAVE THE SPOON IN A CUP
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0075 WHILE DRINKING OUT OF IT BUT AFTER STIRRING THE COCOA OR WHATEVER IT IS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0076 TO LAY THE SPOON IN THE SAUCER A VERY UGLY TABLE HABIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0077 WHICH SEEMS TO BE AN IMPULSE AMONG ALL CHILDREN IS TO PILE A GREAT QUANTITY OF FOOD ON A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0078 AND THEN LICK OR BITE IT OFF PIECEMEAL THIS MUST ON NO ACCOUNT BE PERMITTED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0079 IT IS PERFECTLY CORRECT HOWEVER TO SIP A LITTLE AT A TIME OF HOT LIQUID FROM A SPOON
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0080 IN TAKING ANY LIQUID EITHER FROM A SPOON OR DRINKING VESSEL NO NOISE MUST EVER BE MADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0081 THE FORK AND KNIFE TOGETHER IN BEING TAUGHT TO USE HIS KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0082 THE CHILD SHOULD AT FIRST CUT ONLY SOMETHING VERY EASY SUCH AS A SLICE OF CHICKEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0083 HE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT ANYTHING WITH BONES OR GRISTLE OR ANYTHING THAT IS TOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0084 IN HIS LEFT HAND IS PUT HIS FORK WITH THE PRONGS DOWNWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0085 HELD NEAR THE TOP OF THE HANDLE HIS INDEX FINGER IS PLACED ON THE SHANK SO THAT IT POINTS TO THE PRONGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0086 AND IS SUPPORTED AT THE SIDE BY HIS THUMB HIS OTHER FINGERS CLOSE UNDERNEATH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0087 AND HOLD THE HANDLE TIGHT HE MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HOLD HIS FORK EMIGRANT FASHION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0088 PERPENDICULARLY CLUTCHED IN THE CLENCHED FIST AND TO SAW ACROSS THE FOOD AT ITS BASE WITH HIS KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0089 THE KNIFE THE KNIFE IS HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND EXACTLY AS THE FORK IS HELD IN HIS LEFT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0090 FIRMLY AND AT THE END OF THE HANDLE WITH THE INDEX FINGER POINTING DOWN THE BACK OF THE BLADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0091 IN CUTTING HE SHOULD LEARN NOT TO SCRAPE THE BACK OF THE FORK PRONGS WITH THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0092 HAVING CUT OFF A MOUTHFUL HE THRUSTS THE FORK THROUGH IT WITH PRONGS POINTED DOWNWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0093 AND CONVEYS IT TO HIS MOUTH WITH HIS LEFT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0094 HE MUST LEARN TO CUT OFF AND EAT ONE MOUTHFUL AT A TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0095 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO ADD THAT THE KNIFE MUST NEVER BE PUT IN HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0096 NOR IS IT GOOD FORM TO USE THE KNIFE UNNECESSARILY SOFT FOODS LIKE CROQUETTES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0097 HASH ON TOAST ALL EGGS AND VEGETABLES SHOULD BE CUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0098 OR MERELY BROKEN APART WITH THE EDGE OF THE FORK HELD LIKE THE KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0099 AFTER WHICH THE FORK IS TURNED IN THE HAND TO FIRST OR SHOVEL POSITION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0100 THE KNIFE MUST NEVER BE USED TO SCOOP BAKED POTATO OUT OF THE SKIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0101 OR TO BUTTER POTATO A FORK MUST BE USED FOR ALL MANIPULATIONS OF VEGETABLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0102 BUTTER FOR BAKED POTATOES TAKEN ON THE TIP OF THE FORK SHOVEL FASHION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0103 LAID ON THE POTATO AND THEN PRESSED DOWN AND MIXED WITH THE PRONGS HELD POINTS CURVED UP
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0104 WHEN NO KNIFE IS BEING USED THE FORK IS HELD IN THE RIGHT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0105 WHETHER USED PRONGS DOWN TO IMPALE THE MEAT OR PRONGS UP TO LIFT VEGETABLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0106 TO PILE MASHED POTATO AND OTHER VEGETABLES ON THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0107 ON TOP OF THE MEAT FOR TWO OR MORE INCHES OF ITS LENGTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0108 IS A DISGUSTING HABIT DEAR TO SCHOOL BOYS AND ONE THAT IS MORE EASILY PREVENTED THAN CORRECTED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0109 IN FACT TAKING A BIG MOUTHFUL NEXT TO SMEARING HIS FACE AND CHEWING WITH MOUTH OPEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0110 IS THE WORST OFFENSE AT TABLE WHEN HE HAS FINISHED EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0111 HE SHOULD LAY HIS KNIFE AND FORK CLOSE TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0112 WITH HANDLES TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0113 THE HANDLES PROJECTING AN INCH OR TWO BEYOND THE RIM OF THE PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0114 THEY MUST BE PLACED FAR ENOUGH ON THE PLATE SO THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF THEIR OVER BALANCING ON TO THE TABLE OR FLOOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0115 WHEN REMOVED AT THE END OF THE COURSE OTHER TABLE MATTERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0116 THE DISTANCE FROM THE TABLE AT WHICH IT IS BEST TO SIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0117 IS A MATTER OF PERSONAL COMFORT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0118 A CHILD SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE SO CLOSE THAT HIS ELBOWS ARE BENT LIKE A GRASSHOPPER'S
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0119 NOR SO FAR BACK THAT FOOD IS APT TO BE SPILLED IN TRANSIT FROM PLATE TO MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0120 CHILDREN LIKE TO DRINK VERY LONG AND RAPIDLY ALL IN ONE BREATH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0121 UNTIL THEY ARE PINK AROUND THE EYES AND ARE LITERALLY GASPING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0122 THEY ALSO LOVE TO PUT THEIR WHOLE HANDS IN THEIR FINGER BOWLS AND WIGGLE THEIR FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0123 A BABY OF TWO OR AT LEAST BY THE TIME HE IS THREE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0124 SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO DIP THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS IN THE FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0125 WITHOUT PLAYING DRAW THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND ACROSS HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0126 AND THEN WIPE HIS LIPS AND FINGERS ON THE APRON OF HIS BIB
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0127 NO SMALL CHILD CAN BE EXPECTED TO USE A NAPKIN INSTEAD OF A BIB
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0128 NO MATTER HOW NICELY BEHAVED HE MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS DANGER OF HIS SPILLING SOMETHING SOME TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0129 SOFT BOILED EGG IS HIDEOUSLY DIFFICULT TO EAT WITHOUT EVER GETTING A DROP OF IT DOWN THE FRONT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0130 AND IT IS MUCH EASIER TO SUPPLY HIM WITH A CLEAN BIB FOR THE NEXT MEAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0131 THAN TO CHANGE HIS DRESS FOR THE NEXT MOMENT VERY LITTLE CHILDREN USUALLY HAVE HOT WATER PLATES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0132 THAT ARE SPECIALLY MADE LIKE A DOUBLE PLATE WITH HOT WATER SPACE BETWEEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0133 ON WHICH THE MEAT IS CUT UP AND THE VEGETABLES FIXED IN THE PANTRY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0134 AND BROUGHT TO THE CHILDREN BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE ARE SERVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0135 NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO BE MADE TO WAIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0136 AND HAVE THEIR ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY FOOD NOT FOR THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY TAKE SO LONG TO EAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0137 AS SOON AS THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO EAT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE THEY ARE SERVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0138 NOT LAST BUT IN THE REGULAR ROTATION AT TABLE IN WHICH THEY COME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0139 TABLE TRICKS THAT MUST BE CORRECTED TO SIT UP STRAIGHT AND KEEP THEIR HANDS IN THEIR LAPS WHEN NOT OCCUPIED WITH EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0140 IS VERY HARD FOR A CHILD BUT SHOULD BE INSISTED UPON IN ORDER TO PREVENT A CARELESS ATTITUDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0141 THAT ALL TOO READILY DEGENERATES INTO FLOPPING THIS WAY AND THAT AND INTO FINGERING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0142 WHATEVER IS IN REACH HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO WARM HIS HANDS ON HIS PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0143 OR DRUM ON THE TABLE OR SCREW HIS NAPKIN INTO A ROPE OR MAKE MARKS ON THE TABLECLOTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0144 IF HE SHOWS TALENT AS AN ARTIST GIVE HIM PENCILS OR MODELING WAX IN HIS PLAYROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0145 BUT DO NOT LET HIM BITE HIS SLICE OF BREAD INTO THE SILHOUETTE OF AN ANIMAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0146 OR MODEL FIGURES IN SOFT BREAD AT THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0147 AND DO NOT ALLOW HIM TO CONSTRUCT A TENT OUT OF TWO FORKS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0148 OR AN AUTOMOBILE CHASSIS OUT OF TUMBLERS AND KNIVES FOOD AND TABLE IMPLEMENTS ARE NOT PLAYTHINGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0149 NOR IS THE DINING ROOM A PLAYGROUND TALKING AT TABLE WHEN OLDER PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0150 AND A CHILD WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING HE MUST BE TAUGHT TO STOP EATING MOMENTARILY AND LOOK AT HIS MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0151 WHO AT THE FIRST PAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION WILL SAY WHAT IS IT DEAR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0152 AND THE CHILD THEN HAS HIS SAY IF HE WANTS MERELY TO LAUNCH FORTH ON A LONG SUBJECT OF HIS OWN CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0153 HIS MOTHER SAYS NOT NOW DARLING WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BY AND BY OR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0154 DON'T YOU SEE THAT MOTHER IS TALKING TO AUNT MARY WHEN CHILDREN ARE AT TABLE ALONE WITH THEIR MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0155 THEY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ALLOWED TO TALK BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY TRAINED IN TABLE CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0156 AS WELL AS IN TABLE MANNERS CHILDREN ARE ALL MORE OR LESS LITTLE MONKEYS IN THAT THEY IMITATE EVERYTHING THEY SEE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0157 IF THEIR MOTHER TREATS THEM EXACTLY AS SHE DOES HER VISITORS THEY IN TURN PLAY VISITOR TO PERFECTION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0158 NOTHING HURTS THE FEELINGS OF CHILDREN MORE THAN NOT BEING ALLOWED TO BEHAVE LIKE GROWN PERSONS WHEN THEY THINK THEY ARE ABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0159 TO BE HELPED TO BE FED TO HAVE THEIR FOOD CUT UP
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0160 ALL HAVE A STULTIFYING EFFECT UPON THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS SOON AS THEY HAVE BECOME EXPERT ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT THESE SERVICES FOR THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0161 CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT FROM THE TIME THEY ARE LITTLE NOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T LIKE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0162 A CHILD WHO IS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT NO THANK YOU AT HOME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0163 WILL NOT MORTIFY HIS MOTHER IN PUBLIC BY SCREAMING I HATE STEAK I WON'T EAT POTATO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0164 I WANT ICE CREAM QUIETNESS AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0165 OLDER CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO JERK OUT THEIR CHAIRS TO FLOP DOWN SIDEWAYS TO FLICK THEIR NAPKINS BY ONE CORNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0166 TO REACH OUT FOR SOMETHING OR BEGIN TO EAT NUTS FRUIT OR OTHER TABLE DECORATIONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0167 A CHILD AS WELL AS A GROWN PERSON SHOULD SIT DOWN QUIETLY IN THE CENTER OF HIS CHAIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0168 AND DRAW IT UP TO THE TABLE IF THERE IS NO ONE TO PUSH IT IN FOR HIM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0169 BY HOLDING THE SEAT IN EITHER HAND WHILE MOMENTARILY LIFTING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0170 HE MUST NOT JUMP OR ROCK HIS CHAIR INTO PLACE AT THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0171 IN GETTING UP FROM THE TABLE AGAIN HE MUST PUSH HIS CHAIR BACK QUIETLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0172 USING HIS HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHAIR SEAT AND NOT BY HOLDING ON TO THE TABLE EDGE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0173 AND GIVING HIMSELF CHAIR AND ALL A SUDDEN SHOVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0174 THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A SOUND MADE BY THE PUSHING IN OR OUT OF CHAIRS AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0175 THE SPOILED CHILD THE BAD MANNERS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ARE SUPPOSED BY FOREIGNERS TO BE TYPICAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0176 ARE NEARLY ALWAYS THE RESULT OF THEIR BEING GIVEN STAR PARTS BY OVER FOND BUT EQUALLY OVER FOOLISH MOTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0177 IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO BRING TO MIND THE MOST IRRITATING AND OBJECTIONABLE CHILD ONE KNOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0178 AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT ITS MOTHER CONTINUALLY THROWS THE SPOTLIGHT ON IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0179 BY TALKING TO IT AND ABOUT IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0180 AND BY CALLING ATTENTION TO ITS LOOKS OR ITS CUNNING WAYS OR EVEN POSSIBLY ITS NAUGHTINESS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0181 IT IS HUMANLY NATURAL TO MAKE A FUSS OVER LITTLE CHILDREN PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE PRETTY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0182 AND IT TAKES QUITE SUPER HUMAN CONTROL FOR A YOUNG MOTHER NOT TO SHOW OFF HER TREASURE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0183 BUT TO SAY INSTEAD PLEASE DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0184 SOME CHILDREN WHO ARE ESPECIALLY FREE FROM SELF CONSCIOUSNESS STAND STARDOM BETTER THAN OTHERS WHO ARE MORE READILY SPOILED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0185 BUT IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE OLD FASHIONED METHOD THAT ASSIGNED CHILDREN TO INCONSPICUOUS PLACES IN THE BACKGROUND
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0186 AND DECREED THEY MIGHT BE SEEN BUT NOT HEARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0187 PRODUCED MEN AND WOMEN OF FAR GREATER CHARM THAN THE MODERN METHOD OF ENCOURAGING PUBLIC SELF EXPRESSION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0188 FROM INFANCY UPWARD CHIEF VIRTUE OBEDIENCE NO YOUNG HUMAN BEING ANY MORE THAN A YOUNG DOG
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0189 HAS THE LEAST CLAIM TO ATTRACTIVENESS UNLESS IT IS TRAINED TO MANNERS AND OBEDIENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0190 THE CHILD THAT WHINES INTERRUPTS FUSSES FIDGETS AND DOES NOTHING THAT IT IS TOLD TO DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0191 HAS NOT THE LEAST POWER OF ATTRACTION FOR ANY ONE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY HAVE THE FEATURES OF AN ANGEL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0192 AND BE DRESSED LIKE A PICTURE ANOTHER THAT MAY HAVE NO CLAIM TO BEAUTY WHATEVER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0193 BUT THAT IS SWEET AND NICELY BEHAVED EXERTS CHARM OVER EVERY ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0194 WHEN POSSIBLE A CHILD SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY THE INSTANT IT BECOMES DISOBEDIENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0195 IT SOON LEARNS THAT IT CAN NOT STAY WITH MOTHER UNLESS IT IS WELL BEHAVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0196 THIS MEANS THAT IT LEARNS SELF CONTROL IN BABYHOOD NOT ONLY MUST CHILDREN OBEY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0197 BUT THEY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SHOW OFF OR BECOME PERT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0198 OR TO CONTRADICT OR TO ANSWER BACK AND AFTER HAVING BEEN TOLD NO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0199 THEY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED BY PERSISTENT NAGGING TO WIN YES A CHILD THAT LOSES ITS TEMPER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0200 THAT TEASES THAT IS PETULANT AND DISOBEDIENT AND A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0201 IS MERELY A VICTIM POOR LITTLE THING OF PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TOO INCOMPETENT OR NEGLIGENT TO TRAIN IT TO OBEDIENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0202 MOREOVER THAT SAME CHILD WHEN GROWN WILL BE THE FIRST TO RESENT AND BLAME THE MOTHER'S MISTAKEN SPOILING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0203 AND LACK OF GOOD SENSE FAIR PLAY NOTHING APPEALS TO CHILDREN MORE THAN JUSTICE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0204 AND THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE NURSERY TO PLAY FAIR IN GAMES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0205 TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S PROPERTY AND RIGHTS TO GIVE CREDIT TO OTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0206 AND NOT TO TAKE TOO MUCH CREDIT TO THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0207 EVERY CHILD MUST BE TAUGHT NEVER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE MEAGRE POSSESSIONS OF ANOTHER CHILD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0208 WHOSE PARENTS ARE NOT AS WELL OFF AS HER OWN A PURSE PROUD OVERBEARING CHILD WHO SAYS TO A PLAYMATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0209 MY CLOTHES WERE ALL MADE IN PARIS AND MY DOLL IS EVER SO MUCH HANDSOMER THAN YOURS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0210 OR IS THAT REAL LACE ON YOUR COLLAR IS NOT IMPRESSING HER YOUNG FRIEND WITH HER GRANDEUR AND DISCRIMINATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0211 BUT WITH HER DISAGREEABLENESS AND RUDENESS A BOY WHO BRAGS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0212 AND BOASTS OF WHAT HE CAN DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0213 IS ONLY LESS OBJECTIONABLE BECAUSE OTHER BOYS ARE SURE TO TAKE IT OUT OF HIM PROMPTLY AND THOROUGHLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0214 NOR SHOULD A BRIGHT OBSERVING CHILD BE ENCOURAGED TO PICK OUT OTHER PEOPLE'S FAILINGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0215 OR TO TELL HER MOTHER HOW INFERIOR OTHER CHILDREN ARE COMPARED WITH HERSELF
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0216 IF SHE WINS A RACE OR A MEDAL OR IS PRAISED SHE NATURALLY TELLS HER MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0217 AND HER MOTHER NATURALLY REJOICES WITH HER AND IT IS PROPER THAT SHE SHOULD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0218 BUT A WISE MOTHER DIRECTS HER CHILD'S MENTAL ATTITUDE TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ARROGANCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0219 SELFISHNESS AND CONCEIT CAN WIN NO PLACE WORTH HAVING IN THE WORLD CHILDREN AT AFTERNOON TEA
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0220 A CUSTOM IN MANY FASHIONABLE HOUSES IS TO ALLOW CHILDREN AS SOON AS THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0221 TO COME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM OR LIBRARY AT TEA TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0222 AS NOTHING GIVES THEM A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE IN COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0223 LITTLE BOYS ARE ALWAYS TAUGHT TO BOW TO VISITORS LITTLE GIRLS TO CURTSY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0224 SMALL BOYS ARE TAUGHT TO PLACE THE INDIVIDUAL TABLES HAND PLATES AND TEA
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0225 AND PASS SANDWICHES AND CAKES IF THERE ARE NO BOYS GIRLS PERFORM THIS OFFICE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0226 VERY OFTEN THEY BOTH DO WHEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN HELPED THE CHILDREN ARE PERHAPS ALLOWED A PIECE OF CAKE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0227 WHICH THEY PUT ON A TEA PLATE AND SIT DOWN AND EAT NICELY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0228 BUT AS THE TEA HOUR IS VERY NEAR THEIR SUPPER TIME THEY ARE OFTEN ALLOWED NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0229 AND AFTER MAKING THEMSELVES USEFUL GO OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0230 IF MANY PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AND THE CHILDREN ARE NOT SPOKEN TO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0231 THEY LEAVE THE ROOM UNOBTRUSIVELY AND QUIETLY IF ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE PRESENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0232 ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOM THE CHILDREN KNOW WELL THEY SHAKE HANDS AND SAY GOOD BY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0233 AND WALK NOT RUN OUT OF THE ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0234 THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WELL BRED PEOPLE BECOME USED FROM CHILDHOOD TO INSTINCTIVE GOOD MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0235 UNLESS THEY ARE SPOKEN TO THEY WOULD NOT THINK OF SPEAKING OR MAKING THEMSELVES NOTICED IN ANY WAY VERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0236 LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF DISCRETION WHICH MAY BE PLACED AT ABOUT FIVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0237 POSSIBLY NOT UNTIL SIX USUALLY GO IN THE DRAWING ROOM AT TEA TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0238 ONLY WHEN NEAR RELATIVES OR INTIMATE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY ARE THERE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0239 NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS WASHED AND DRESSED SOME CHILDREN WEAR SPECIAL AFTERNOON CLOTHES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0240 BUT USUALLY THE CLEAN CLOTHES PUT ON AT TEA TIME GO ON AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0241 EXCEPT THE THIN SOCKS AND HOUSE SLIPPERS WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR THE EVENING HOUR OF THEIR DAY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0242 CHILDREN'S PARTIES A SMALL GIRL OR BOY GIVING A PARTY SHOULD RECEIVE WITH HER MOTHER AT THE DOOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0243 AND GREET ALL HER FRIENDS AS THEY COME IN IF IT IS HER BIRTHDAY AND OTHER CHILDREN BRING HER GIFTS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0244 SHE MUST SAY THANK YOU POLITELY ON NO ACCOUNT MUST SHE BE ALLOWED TO TELL A CHILD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0245 I HATE DOLLS IF A FRIEND HAS BROUGHT HER ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0246 SHE MUST LEARN AT AN EARLY AGE THAT AS HOSTESS SHE MUST THINK OF HER GUESTS RATHER THAN HERSELF
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0247 AND NOT WANT THE BEST TOYS IN THE GRAB BAG OR SCREAM BECAUSE ANOTHER CHILD GETS THE PRIZE THAT IS OFFERED IN A CONTEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0248 IF BEATEN IN A GAME A LITTLE GIRL NO LESS THAN HER BROTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0249 MUST NEVER CRY OR COMPLAIN THAT THE CONTEST IS NOT FAIR WHEN SHE LOSES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0250 SHE MUST TRY TO HELP HER GUESTS HAVE A GOOD TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0251 AND NOT INSIST ON PLAYING THE GAME SHE LIKES INSTEAD OF THOSE WHICH THE OTHER CHILDREN SUGGEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0252 WHEN SHE HERSELF GOES TO A PARTY SHE MUST SAY HOW DO YOU DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0253 WHEN SHE ENTERS THE ROOM AND CURTSY TO THE LADY WHO RECEIVES A BOY MAKES A BOW
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0254 THEY SHOULD HAVE EQUALLY GOOD MANNERS AS WHEN AT HOME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0255 AND NOT TRY TO GRAB MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF FAVORS OR TOYS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0256 WHEN IT IS TIME TO GO HOME THEY MUST SAY GOOD BY I HAD A VERY GOOD TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0257 OR GOOD BY THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH THE CHILD'S REPLY IF THE HOSTESS SAYS

chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0259 IN ALL MONOSYLLABIC REPLIES A CHILD MUST NOT SAY YES OR NO OR WHAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0260 A BOY IN ANSWERING A GENTLEMAN STILL USES THE OLD FASHIONED YES SIR NO SIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0261 I THINK SO SIR BUT MA'AM HAS GONE OUT OF STYLE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS MUST THEREFORE ANSWER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0262 NO MRS SMITH YES MISS JONES A GIRL SAYS YES MR SMITH RATHER THAN SIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0263 ALL CHILDREN SHOULD SAY WHAT DID YOU SAY MOTHER NO FATHER THANK YOU AUNT KATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0264 YES UNCLE FRED ETC THEY NEED NOT INSERT A NAME IN A LONG SENTENCE NOR WITH PLEASE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0265 OR THANK YOU YES PLEASE OR NO THANK YOU IS QUITE SUFFICIENT OR IN ANSWERING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0266 I JUST SAW MARY DOWN IN THE GARDEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADD MRS SMITH AT THE END
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0267 ETIQUETTE FOR GROWN CHILDREN ETIQUETTE FOR GROWN CHILDREN IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS FOR GROWN PERSONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0268 EXCEPTING THAT IN MANY WAYS THE MANNERS EXACTED OF YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE ALERT AND PUNCTILIOUS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0269 YOUNG GIRLS AND BOYS OF COURSE SHOULD HAVE THE MANNERS OF A GENTLEMAN RATHER THAN THOSE OF A LADY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0270 IN THAT A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS RISES RELINQUISHES THE BEST SEAT AND WALKS LAST INTO A ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0271 WHEREAS THESE COURTESIES ARE SHOWN TO AND NOT OBSERVED BY LADIES EXCEPT TO OTHER LADIES OLDER THAN THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0272 IN GIVING PARTIES YOUNG GIRLS SEND OUT THEIR INVITATIONS AS THEIR MOTHERS DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0273 AND THEIR DEPORTMENT IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THEIR DEBUTANTE SISTER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0274 BOYS BEHAVE AS THEIR FATHERS DO AND ARE EQUALLY PUNCTILIOUS IN FOLLOWING THE CODE OF HONOR OF ALL GENTLEMEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0275 THE ONLY DETAILS THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO BE DESCRIBED IN OTHER CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0276 ARE A FEW ADMONITIONS ON TABLE MANNERS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT ABOVE KINDERGARTEN GRADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0277 THE GRADUATING TESTS IN TABLE MANNERS A YOUNG PERSON MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GRADUATED FROM THE SCHOOL OF TABLE ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0278 WHEN SHE OR HE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0279 WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT AT A FORMAL LUNCH OR DINNER TABLE AND FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN EATING PROPERLY ANY OF THE COMESTIBLES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HURDLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0280 TO THE INEXPERT CORN ON THE COB
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0281 CORN ON THE COB COULD BE ELIMINATED SO FAR AS EVER HAVING TO EAT IT IN FORMAL COMPANY IS CONCERNED
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0282 SINCE IT IS NEVER SERVED AT A LUNCHEON OR A DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0283 BUT IF YOU INSIST ON EATING IT AT HOME OR IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0284 TO ATTACK IT WITH AS LITTLE FEROCITY AS POSSIBLE IS PERHAPS THE ONLY DIRECTION TO BE GIVEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0285 SINCE AT BEST IT IS AN UNGRACEFUL PERFORMANCE AND TO EAT IT GREEDILY A HORRIBLE SIGHT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0286 ASPARAGUS ALTHOUGH ASPARAGUS MAY BE TAKEN IN THE FINGERS DON'T TAKE A LONG DROOPING STALK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0287 HOLD IT UP IN THE AIR AND CATCH THE END OF IT IN YOUR MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0288 LIKE A FISH WHEN THE STALKS ARE THIN IT IS BEST TO CUT THEM IN HALF WITH THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0289 EATING THE TIPS LIKE ALL FORK FOOD THE ENDS MAY THEN BE TAKEN IN THE FINGERS AND EATEN WITHOUT A DROPPING FOUNTAIN EFFECT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0290 DON'T SQUEEZE THE STALKS OR HOLD YOUR HAND BELOW THE END AND LET THE JUICE RUN DOWN YOUR ARM
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0291 ARTICHOKES ARTICHOKES ARE ALWAYS EATEN WITH THE FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0293 AND THEN BITTEN OFF BREAD AND BUTTER BREAD SHOULD ALWAYS BE BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES WITH THE FINGERS BEFORE BEING EATEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0294 IF IT IS TO BE BUTTERED AT LUNCH BREAKFAST OR SUPPER BUT NOT AT DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0295 A PIECE IS HELD ON THE EDGE OF THE BREAD AND BUTTER PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0296 OR THE PLACE PLATE AND ENOUGH BUTTER SPREAD ON IT FOR A MOUTHFUL OR TWO AT A TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0297 WITH A SMALL SILVER BUTTER KNIFE BREAD MUST NEVER BE HELD FLAT ON THE PALM OF THE HAND AND BUTTERED IN THE AIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0298 IF THE REGULAR STEEL KNIFE IS USED CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO SMEAR FOOD FROM THE KNIFE'S SIDE ON THE BUTTER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0299 ANY FOOD THAT IS SMEARED ABOUT IS LOATHSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEAUTIFUL TABLE MANNERS ALWAYS KEEP THEIR PLACES AT TABLE NEAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0300 PEOPLE WITH DISGUSTING MANNERS GET EVERYTHING IN A HORRIBLE MESS THE MANAGEMENT OF BONES AND PITS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0301 TERRAPIN BONES FISH BONES AND GRAPE SEED MUST BE EATEN QUITE BARE AND CLEAN IN THE MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0302 AND REMOVED ONE AT A TIME BETWEEN FINGER AND THUMB
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0303 ALL SPITTING OUT OF BONES AND PITS INTO THE PLATE IS DISGUSTING IF FOOD IS TOO HOT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0304 QUICKLY TAKE A SWALLOW OF WATER ON NO ACCOUNT SPIT IT OUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0305 IF FOOD HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO YOUR MOUTH NO MATTER HOW YOU HATE IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0306 YOU HAVE GOT TO SWALLOW IT IT IS UNFORGIVABLE TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0307 EXCEPT DRY BONES AND STONES TO SPIT ANYTHING WHATEVER INTO THE CORNER OF YOUR NAPKIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0308 IS TOO NAUSEATING TO COMMENT ON
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0309 IT IS HORRID TO SEE ANY ONE SPIT SKINS OR PITS ON A FORK OR INTO THE PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0310 THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS BETWEEN FIRST FINGER AND THUMB
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0311 DRY GRAPE SEEDS OR CHERRY PITS CAN BE DROPPED FROM THE LIPS INTO THE CUPPED HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0312 PEACHES OR OTHER VERY JUICY FRUITS ARE PEELED AND THEN EATEN WITH KNIFE AND FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0313 BUT DRY FRUITS SUCH AS APPLES MAY BE CUT AND THEN EATEN IN THE FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0314 NEVER WIPE HANDS THAT HAVE FRUIT JUICE ON THEM ON A NAPKIN WITHOUT FIRST USING A FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0315 BECAUSE FRUIT JUICES MAKE INDELIBLE STAINS BIRDS BIRDS ARE NOT EATEN WITH THE FINGERS IN COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0316 YOU CUT OFF AS MUCH OF THE MEAT AS YOU CAN AND LEAVE THE REST ON YOUR PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0317 FORKS OR FINGERS ALL JUICY OR GOOEY FRUITS OR CAKES ARE BEST EATEN WITH A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0318 BUT IN MOST CASES IT IS A MATTER OF DEXTERITY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0319 IF YOU ARE ABLE TO EAT A PEACH IN YOUR FINGERS AND NOT SMEAR YOUR FACE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0320 LET JUICE RUN DOWN OR MAKE A SUCKING NOISE YOU ARE THE ONE IN A THOUSAND WHO MAY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0321 AND WITH UTMOST PROPRIETY CONTINUE THE FEAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0322 IF YOU CAN EAT A NAPOLEON OR A CREAM PUFF AND NOT LET THE CREAM OOZE OUT ON THE FAR SIDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0323 YOU NEED NOT USE A FORK BUT IF YOU CAN NOT EAT SOMETHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0324 NO MATTER WHAT IT IS WITHOUT GETTING IT ALL OVER YOUR FINGERS YOU MUST USE A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0325 AND IF NECESSARY A KNIFE ALSO ALL RULES OF TABLE MANNERS ARE MADE TO AVOID UGLINESS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0326 TO LET ANY ONE SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MOUTH IS REPULSIVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0327 TO MAKE A NOISE IS TO SUGGEST AN ANIMAL TO MAKE A MESS IS DISGUSTING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0328 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TRIFLING DECREES OF ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0329 THAT ARE MERELY FINICAL UNREASONABLE AND SILLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0330 WHY ONE SHOULD NOT CUT ONE'S SALAD IN SMALL PIECES IF ONE WANTS TO MAKES LITTLE SENSE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0331 UNLESS ONE WANTS TO CUT UP A WHOLE PLATEFUL AND MAKE THE PLATE MESSY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0332 A STEEL KNIFE MUST NOT BE USED FOR SALAD OR FRUIT BECAUSE IT TURNS BLACK
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0333 TO CONDEMN THE AMERICAN CUSTOM OF EATING A SOFT BOILED EGG IN A GLASS OR CUP
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0334 BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE THE ENGLISH FASHION TO SCOOP IT THROUGH THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE SHELL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0335 IS ABOUT AS REASONABLE AS THOUGH WE WERE TO PROCLAIM ENGLISH MANNERS BAD BECAUSE THEY TAG A BREAKFAST DISH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0336 CALLED A SAVORY OF FISH ROE OR SOMETHING EQUALLY INAPPROPRIATE AFTER THE DESSERT AT DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0337 MANY OTHER ARBITRARY RULES FOR EATING FOOD WITH FORK SPOON OR FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0338 ARE ALSO STUMBLING BLOCKS RATHER THAN AIDS TO SMOOTHNESS AS SAID ABOVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0339 ONE EATS WITH A FORK OR SPOON FINGER FOODS THAT ARE MESSY AND STICKY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0340 ONE EATS WITH THE FINGER THOSE WHICH ARE DRY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0341 IT IS TRUE THAT ONE SHOULD NOT EAT FRENCH FRIED POTATOES OR SARATOGA CHIPS IN FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0342 BUT THAT IS BECAUSE THEY BELONG TO THE MEAT COURSE SEPARATE VEGETABLE SAUCERS ARE NEVER PUT ON A FASHIONABLE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0343 NEITHER IS BUTTER ALLOWED AT DINNER THEREFORE BOTH MUST BE AVOIDED IN COMPANY BECAUSE COMPANY IS FORMAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0344 AND ETIQUETTE IS FIRST AID ALWAYS TO FORMALITY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0345 BUT IF A MAN IN HIS OWN HOUSE LIKES BUTTER WITH HIS DINNER OR A SAUCER FOR HIS TOMATOES
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0346 HE IS BREAKING THE RULE OF FASHION TO HAVE THEM BUT HE IS SCARCELY COMMITTING AN OFFENSE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0347 IN THE SAME WAY IF HE LIKES TO EAT A CHICKEN WING OR A SQUAB LEG IN HIS FINGERS HE CAN ASK FOR A FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0348 THE REAL OBJECTION TO EATING WITH THE FINGERS IS GETTING THEM GREASY OR STICKY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0349 AND TO SUCK THEM OR SMEAR ONE'S NAPKIN IS EQUALLY UNSIGHTLY ON THE SUBJECT OF ELBOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0350 ALTHOUGH ELBOWS ON THE TABLE ARE SEEN CONSTANTLY IN HIGHEST FASHIONABLE CIRCLES A
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0351 WHOLE TABLE'S LENGTH OF ELBOWS PLANTED LIKE CLOTHES LINE POLES AND HANDS WAVING GLASSES OR FORKS ABOUT IN BETWEEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0352 IS NEITHER AN ATTRACTIVE NOR FORTUNATELY AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF A FASHIONABLE DINNER TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0353 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE TOLERATED ELBOW ON TABLE IS USED ONLY ON OCCASION AND FOR A REASON
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0354 AND SHOULD NEITHER BE PERMITTED TO CHILDREN NOR PRACTISED IN THEIR PRESENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0355 ELBOWS ARE UNIVERSALLY SEEN ON TABLES IN RESTAURANTS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0356 ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE LUNCHING OR DINING AT A SMALL TABLE OF TWO OR FOUR
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0357 AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ONESELF HEARD ABOVE THE MUSIC BY ONE'S TABLE COMPANIONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0358 AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT BE HEARD AT OTHER TABLES NEARBY WITHOUT LEANING FAR FORWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0359 AND IN LEANING FORWARD A WOMAN'S FIGURE MAKES A MORE GRACEFUL OUTLINE SUPPORTED ON HER ELBOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0360 THAN DOUBLED FORWARD OVER HER HANDS IN HER LAP AS THOUGH IN PAIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0361 AT HOME WHEN THERE IS NO REASON FOR LEANING ACROSS THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0362 THERE IS NO REASON FOR ELBOWS AND AT A DINNER OF CEREMONY
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0363 ELBOWS ON THE TABLE ARE RARELY SEEN EXCEPT AT THE ENDS OF THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0364 WHERE AGAIN ONE HAS TO LEAN FORWARD IN ORDER TO TALK TO A COMPANION AT A DISTANCE ACROSS THE TABLE CORNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0365 ELBOWS ARE NEVER PUT ON THE TABLE WHILE ONE IS EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0366 TO SIT WITH THE LEFT ELBOW PROPPED ON THE TABLE WHILE EATING WITH THE RIGHT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0367 UNLESS ONE IS ALONE AND ILL OR TO PROP THE RIGHT ONE ON THE TABLE WHILE LIFTING THE FORK OR GLASS TO THE MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos/wav/eti0368 MUST BE AVOIDED END OF CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE

chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0089 GLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
chris-20090701-scf/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS

chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
chris21-20091001-qzz/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON

cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
cj5-20090115-cjo/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0011 THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0012 FROM A CAMP ON THE SOUTH FORK OF THE MERCED MAJOR SAVAGE SENT INDIAN RUNNERS TO THE BANDS WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HIDING IN THE MOUNTAINS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0013 INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0014 THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0016 NONE OF THE YOSEMITE INDIANS RESPONDED TO THIS GENERAL MESSAGE BUT WHEN A SPECIAL MESSENGER WAS SENT TO THE CHIEF
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0017 HE APPEARED THE NEXT DAY HE CAME ENTIRELY ALONE AND STOOD IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE BEFORE ONE OF THE GUARDS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0018 UNTIL INVITED TO ENTER THE CAMP HE WAS RECOGNIZED BY ONE OF THE FRIENDLY INDIANS AS TENAYA

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0063 FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0064 AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0065 THE TRIBE HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO NUMBER OVER TWO HUNDRED MAJOR SAVAGE THEN SAID TO HIM

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0076 THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0077 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0081 THE NAME YOSEMITE PROPOSED BY DR BUNELL
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0082 WAS ADOPTED ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY TO PERPETUATE THE NAME OF THE TRIBE WHO SO LONG HAD MADE THEIR HOME THERE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0083 THE INDIAN NAME OF THE VALLEY HOWEVER IS AHWAHNEE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0084 THE INDIANS HAD NAMES FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT ROCKS AND STREAMS OF THE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0085 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM ARE NOW IN USE BY THE WHITES POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0086 BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0087 HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0088 ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0089 THUS IN THREE DAYS THE ROUND TRIP HAD BEEN MADE TO THE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0090 MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0091 BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0092 A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0093 WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0094 SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0095 LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0096 WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0097 THREE OF THE FIVE WERE SONS OF THE OLD CHIEF AND THE ROCK WAS NAMED FOR THEM
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0098 ALL OF THESE CAPTIVES MADE GOOD THEIR ESCAPE WITHIN A FEW DAYS EXCEPT THE YOUNGEST SON OF TENAYA
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0099 WHO WAS SHOT BY HIS GUARD WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0100 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0101 BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0102 HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING THROUGH AN INTERPRETER
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0103 EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0104 LATER HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0105 TENAYA EXPECTED TO BE SHOT FOR THIS ATTEMPT AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0106 KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0107 IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU YOU WOULD KILL ALL MY TRIBE IF YOU HAD THE POWER
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0108 YES SIR AMERICA YOU CAN NOW TELL YOUR WARRIORS TO KILL THE OLD CHIEF
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0109 YOU HAVE MADE MY LIFE DARK WITH SORROW YOU KILLED THE CHILD OF MY HEART

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0111 AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0117 BUT BE WITH THE SPIRITS AMONG THE ROCKS THE WATERFALLS IN THE RIVERS AND IN THE WINDS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0118 WHEREVER YOU GO I WILL BE WITH YOU YOU WILL NOT SEE ME
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0119 BUT YOU WILL FEAR THE SPIRIT OF THE OLD CHIEF AND GROW COLD THE GREAT SPIRIT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0120 HAS SPOKEN I AM DONE THIS EXPEDITION FINALLY CAPTURED THE REMNANTS OF THE TRIBES AT THE HEAD OF LAKE TENAYA
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0121 AND TOOK THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION TOGETHER WITH THEIR CHIEF TENAYA BUT AFTER A SHORT STAY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0122 THEY WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THE VALLEY UNDER RESTRICTIONS TENAYA PROMISED FAITHFULLY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0123 TO CONFORM TO EVERYTHING REQUIRED JOYFULLY LEFT THE HOT AND DRY RESERVATION AND WITH HIS FAMILY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0124 RETURNED TO HIS YOSEMITE HOME THE FOLLOWING YEAR A PARTY OF MINERS WAS ATTACKED BY THE INDIANS IN THE VALLEY AND

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0126 DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE USA WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0127 LIEUTENANT MOORE ENTERED THE VALLEY IN THE NIGHT AND SURPRISED AND CAPTURED A PARTY OF FIVE INDIANS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0128 BUT AN ALARM WAS GIVEN AND TENAYA AND HIS PEOPLE FLED FROM THEIR HUTS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0129 AND ESCAPED TO THE MONOS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RANGE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0130 ON EXAMINATION OF THE FIVE PRISONERS IN THE MORNING
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0131 IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT EACH OF THEM HAD SOME ARTICLE OF CLOTHING THAT BELONGED TO THE MURDERED MEN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0132 THE BODIES OF THE TWO MINERS WERE FOUND AND BURIED ON THE EDGE OF THE BRIDAL VEIL MEADOW
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0133 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0134 THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0135 DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0136 LIEUTENANT MOORE TOLD THEM THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER THAT THEY HAD SOLD THEIR LANDS TO THE GOVERNMENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0137 THAT IT BELONGED TO THE WHITE MEN NOW AND THAT THEY HAD AGREED TO LIVE ON THE RESERVATION PROVIDED FOR THEM
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0138 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0139 AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0140 HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0141 PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0142 BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM AFTER BEING HOSPITABLY ENTERTAINED AND PROTECTED BY THE MONO AND PAUTE TRIBES
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0143 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0144 AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0145 REACHED THEIR YOSEMITE HOME ONCE MORE BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0146 A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0147 ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON THE TENAYA CANYON AND LAKE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0148 WERE NAMED FOR THE FAMOUS OLD CHIEF VERY FEW VISITS WERE MADE TO THE VALLEY BEFORE THE SUMMER OR EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0149 WHEN MR J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0150 AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE AND IN HIS CALIFORNIA MAGAZINE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0151 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0152 THIS FIRST PARTY WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FROM MARIPOSA THE SAME YEAR CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0153 THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0154 WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0155 AND MADE FREE TO THE PUBLIC THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0156 WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0157 AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0158 AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM IT WAS SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE YOSEMITE FALL
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0159 A LITTLE OVER HALF A MILE FARTHER UP THE VALLEY A CANVAS HOUSE

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0162 AFTERWARD BY MR LONGHURST AND SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BY MR HUTCHINGS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0163 ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0164 WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0165 IS NOW THE ONLY HOTEL IN THE VALLEY A LARGE HOTEL BUILT BY THE STATE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0166 AND LOCATED FARTHER UP THE VALLEY WAS BURNED TO PROVIDE FOR THE OVERFLOW OF VISITORS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0167 THERE ARE THREE CAMPS WITH BOARD FLOORS WOOD FRAME AND COVERED WITH CANVAS WELL FURNISHED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0168 SOME OF THEM WITH ELECTRIC LIGHT A LARGE FIRST CLASS HOTEL IS VERY MUCH NEEDED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0169 TRAVEL OF LATE YEARS HAS BEEN RAPIDLY INCREASING ESPECIALLY AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0170 BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0171 AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN OH FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0172 THE GREATEST INCREASE OF COURSE WAS CAUSED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY RAILROAD FROM MERCED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0173 TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0174 AND THE ENTIRE DISTANCE EXCEPT THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MILES FROM THE TOWN OF MERCED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0175 IS BUILT THROUGH THE PRECIPITOUS MERCED RIVER CANYON THE ROADBED WAS VIRTUALLY BLASTED OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK

cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0177 AND THE FIRST TRAIN ENTERED EL PORTAL THE TERMINUS APRIL FIFTEEN NINETEEN OH SEVEN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0178 MANY MILES OF THE ROAD COST AS MUCH AS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MILE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0179 ITS BUSINESS HAS INCREASED FROM FOUR THOUSAND TOURISTS IN THE FIRST YEAR IT WAS OPERATED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos/wav/yos0180 TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN NINETEEN TEN END OF SECTION THIRTEEN

cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
cmp1988-20080507-qrt/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK

ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
ColinBeckingham-20091029-hfv/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
ColinBeckingham-20091103-clz/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
ColinBeckingham-20091103-fwl/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
ColinBeckingham-20091103-zvt/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
ColinBeckingham-20091104-fqx/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE

ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
ColinBeckingham-20091104-uhr/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
ColinBeckingham-20091121-grq/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET

ColinBeckingham-20091121-ouu/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
ColinBeckingham-20091121-ouu/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
ColinBeckingham-20091121-ouu/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
ColinBeckingham-20091211-lfs/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
ColinBeckingham-20091211-zcy/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
ColinBeckingham-20091213-blg/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
ColinBeckingham-20091213-dnz/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-gzk/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
ColinBeckingham-20091213-tqw/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
ColinBeckingham-20091213-wdh/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
ColinBeckingham-20091214-ddc/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-jbh/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
ColinBeckingham-20091214-nsa/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
ColinBeckingham-20091214-wze/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
ColinBeckingham-20100116-crs/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
ColinBeckingham-20100116-uja/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
ColinBeckingham-20100118-fao/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
ColinBeckingham-20100118-scg/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
ColinBeckingham-20100118-snw/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
ColinBeckingham-20100118-vib/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
ColinBeckingham-20100119-amx/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
ColinBeckingham-20100119-btm/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
ColinBeckingham-20100119-ogj/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN

ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
ColinBeckingham-20100119-vlt/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
corno1979-20070615/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
corno1979-20080308-xlg/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
corno1979-20080317-ayn/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
corno1979-20080317-ebe/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
corno1979-20080317-kex/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
corno1979-20080317-oxk/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
corno1979-20080520-agj/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
corno1979-20080520-ghu/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
corno1979-20080520-jmr/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
corno1979-20080520-vdn/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
corno1979-20080520-xqg/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
corno1979-20081220-ebp/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
corno1979-20081220-idl/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
corno1979-20081220-qmh/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
corno1979-20081220-quk/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
corno1979-20081220-smn/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
corno1979-20081220-vba/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
corno1979-20081220-vzq/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
corno1979-20081220-wic/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
corno1979-20081220-yrz/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
corno1979-20090316-len/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
corno1979-20090316-mjl/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
corno1979-20090316-ncj/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
corno1979-20090316-pnj/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
corno1979-20090316-qan/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW

corno1979-20090316-sfh/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
corno1979-20090316-sfh/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
corno1979-20090316-sfh/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY

corno1979-20090316-une/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-une/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND

corno1979-20090316-une/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
corno1979-20090316-une/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
corno1979-20090316-uoi/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
covellot-20081129-qap/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
covellot-20081129-qap/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
covellot-20081129-qap/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
covellot-20081129-qap/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
covellot-20081129-qap/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER

covellot-20081129-xsd/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
covellot-20081129-xsd/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
covellot-20081129-xsd/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
covellot-20090221-ffc/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
covellot-20090221-ffc/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART

DanR-20090223-fys/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
DanR-20090223-qnv/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
DanR-20090223-uln/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
DantheMan-20100110-pgq/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
Dantheman-20100110-yvz/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-1 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-2 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-3 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-4 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-5 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-6 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-7 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-8 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
danuthaiduc-20080128/wav/rp-9 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
danuthaiduc-20080129-our/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
data-20091217-geo/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
dave-20090801-bmc/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
DavidG-20071112-llp/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
davidjamesmcdermott-20100109-zvn/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
DavidL-20091116-kth/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
DavidL-20091117-bnh/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
DavidL-20091117-csg/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
DavidL-20091117-duk/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
DavidL-20091117-fwe/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
DavidL-20091117-gcr/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
DavidL-20091117-gjs/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
DavidL-20091117-goj/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
DavidL-20091117-ixh/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
DavidL-20091117-mlw/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
DavidL-20091117-mlw/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
DavidL-20091117-mlw/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
DavidL-20091117-mlw/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
DavidL-20091117-mlw/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND

doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK

doogent-20091011-ouf/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY

doogent-20091011-ysg/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
doogent-20091011-ysg/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
doogent-20091011-ysg/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY

douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-01 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-03 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-07 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-09 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
douglaid-20080203/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-01 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-02 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-03 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-04 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-05 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-08 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
douglaid-20080204/wav/vf4-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-1 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-2 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-3 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-4 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-5 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-6 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-7 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-8 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
douglaid-20080205/wav/vf5-9 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-02 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-03 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-04 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-05 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-06 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-07 HOW MUCH WAS IT
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-08 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-09 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-16 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-21 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-27 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-28 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-29 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER

douglaid-20080206/wav/vf6-34 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL

douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-10 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION

douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD

douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-36 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-3 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-4 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-5 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-6 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-7 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-8 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
douglaid-20080210/wav/vf7-9 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-01 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-02 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-03 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-04 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-05 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-06 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-07 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-08 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-09 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-10 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-11 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-12 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-13 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-14 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-15 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-16 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-17 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-18 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-19 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-20 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-21 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-22 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-23 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-24 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-25 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-26 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-27 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-28 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-29 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-30 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-31 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-32 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-33 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-34 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-35 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-36 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-37 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-38 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-39 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
douglaid-20080213/wav/vf8-40 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-01 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-02 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-03 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-04 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-05 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-06 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-07 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-08 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-09 AH INDEED
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-10 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-11 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-12 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-13 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-14 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-15 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-16 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-17 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-18 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-19 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-20 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-21 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-22 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-23 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-24 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-25 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-26 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-27 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-28 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-29 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-30 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-31 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-32 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-33 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-34 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-35 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-36 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-37 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-38 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-39 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
douglaid-20080214/wav/vf9-40 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-01 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-02 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-03 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-04 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-05 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-06 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-07 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-08 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-09 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
douglaid-20080216/wav/vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-01 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-02 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-03 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-04 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-05 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-06 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-07 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-08 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-09 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-10 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-11 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-12 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-13 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-14 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-15 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-16 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-17 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-18 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-19 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-20 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-21 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-22 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-23 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-24 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-25 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-26 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-27 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-28 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-29 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-30 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-31 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-32 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-33 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-34 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-35 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-36 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-37 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-38 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEEN NINETEEN OH EIGHT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-39 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OH EIGHT
douglaid-20080219/wav/vf11-40 YES SIR I CORRECTED
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
douglaid-200802/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-01 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-02 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-04 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-07 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-08 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-20 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-21 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
douglaid-20080310/wav/vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-15 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-1 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-2 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-3 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-4 NO-SIR-EE
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-5 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-6 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-7 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-8 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
douglaid-20080801/wav/vf13-9 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
dragon_788-20071103-udu/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
dremp-20080116-zsb/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
dsnyder-20080620-dgt/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
dsnyder-20080620-hhc/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
dsnyder-20080620-mmp/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
dsnyder-20080620-qea/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
dsnyder-20080620-utf/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
dsnyder-20080620-vdr/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
dsnyder-20080620-vpx/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
dsnyder-20080620-xpu/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
dsnyder-20080620-zgu/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
dturing-20080602-anv/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
dturing-20080602-ixr/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE

ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0008 AS SURE AS YOU'RE ALIVE NOW PETER RABBIT SOME DAY I WILL CATCH YOU SNARLED REDDY FOX
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0009 AS HE POKED HIS BLACK NOSE IN THE HOLE BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF THE BIG HICKORY TREE WHICH GROWS CLOSE TO THE SMILING POOL
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0010 IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE NOT ONE JUMP FARTHER AWAY FROM THIS HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0011 PETER SAFE INSIDE THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0012 DIDN'T HAVE A WORD TO SAY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0013 OR IF HE DID
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0014 HE DIDN'T HAVE BREATH ENOUGH TO SAY IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0015 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HE HAD BEEN ONE JUMP FARTHER FROM THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0016 REDDY FOX WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0017 AS IT WAS THE HAIRS ON PETER'S FUNNY WHITE TAIL ACTUALLY HAD TICKLED REDDY'S BACK
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0018 AS PETER PLUNGED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0019 FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE ROOT BOUND ENTRANCE TO THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0020 IT HAD BEEN THE NARROWEST ESCAPE PETER HAD HAD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0021 FOR A LONG LONG TIME
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0022 YOU SEE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0023 REDDY FOX HAD SURPRISED PETER NIBBLING SWEET CLOVER ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POND
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0024 AND IT HAD BEEN A LUCKY THING FOR PETER THAT THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0025 DUG LONG AGO BY JOHNNY CHUCK'S GRANDFATHER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0026 HAD BEEN RIGHT WHERE IT WAS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0027 ALSO IT WAS A LUCKY THING THAT OLD MR CHUCK HAD BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ENTRANCE BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF THAT TREE IN SUCH A WAY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0028 THAT IT COULD NOT BE DUG ANY LARGER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0029 REDDY FOX WAS TOO SHREWD TO WASTE ANY TIME TRYING TO DIG IT LARGER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0030 HE KNEW THERE WASN'T ROOM ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GET BETWEEN THOSE ROOTS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0031 SO AFTER TRYING TO MAKE PETER AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE BY TELLING HIM WHAT HE REDDY WOULD DO TO HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0032 WHEN HE DID CATCH HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0033 REDDY TROTTED OFF ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0034 PETER REMAINED WHERE HE WAS FOR A LONG TIME
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0035 WHEN HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0036 CREPT OUT AND HURRIED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0037 UP TO THE OLD ORCHARD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0038 HE FELT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST PLACE FOR HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0039 BECAUSE THERE WERE EVER SO MANY HIDING PLACES IN THE OLD STONE WALL ALONG THE EDGE OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0040 WHEN PETER REACHED THE OLD ORCHARD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0041 WHO SHOULD HE SEE BUT JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0042 JENNY HAD ARRIVED THAT VERY MORNING FROM THE SUNNY SOUTH WHERE SHE HAD SPENT THE WINTER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0043 TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0044 TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0045 EXCLAIMED JENNY AS SOON AS SHE SAW PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0046 IF HERE ISN'T PETER RABBIT HIMSELF
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0047 HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF REDDY FOX ALL THE LONG WINTER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0048 PETER CHUCKLED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0049 I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH REDDY DURING THE WINTER SAID HE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0050 BUT THIS VERY MORNING HE SO NEARLY CAUGHT ME THAT IT IS A WONDER THAT MY HAIR IS NOT SNOW WHITE FROM FRIGHT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0051 THEN HE TOLD JENNY ALL ABOUT HIS NARROW ESCAPE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0052 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT HANDY HOLE OF GRANDFATHER CHUCK I COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ESCAPED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0053 CONCLUDED PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0054 JENNY WREN COCKED HER PERT LITTLE HEAD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0055 ON ONE SIDE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0056 AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0057 WHY DON'T YOU LEARN TO SWIM PETER LIKE YOUR COUSIN DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH SHE DEMANDED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0058 IF HE HAD BEEN IN YOUR PLACE HE WOULD SIMPLY HAVE PLUNGED INTO THE SMILING POOL AND LAUGHED AT REDDY FOX
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0059 PETER SAT BOLT UPRIGHT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0061 VERY WIDE OPEN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0062 IN THEM WAS A FUNNY LOOK OF SURPRISE AS HE STARED UP AT JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0063 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JENNY WREN HE DEMANDED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0064 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NONE OF THE RABBIT FAMILY SWIM UNLESS IT IS TO CROSS THE LAUGHING BROOK WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0065 OR WHEN ACTUALLY DRIVEN INTO THE WATER BY AN ENEMY FROM WHOM THERE IS NO OTHER ESCAPE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0066 I CAN SWIM A LITTLE IF I HAVE TO
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0067 BUT YOU DON'T CATCH ME IN THE WATER WHEN I CAN STAY ON LAND
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0068 WHAT IS MORE YOU WON'T FIND ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY DOING SUCH A THING
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0069 TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0070 TUT PETER EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN IN HER SHARP SCOLDING VOICE TUT TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0071 FOR A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN SO CURIOUS ABOUT THE WAYS OF HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0072 YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0073 IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0074 I WOULD LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT MY OWN RELATIVES BEFORE I BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT MY NEIGHBORS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0075 HOW MANY RELATIVES HAVE YOU PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0076 ONE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0077 REPLIED PETER PROMPTLY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0078 MY BIG COUSIN JUMPER THE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0079 JENNY WREN THREW BACK HER HEAD AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0080 IT WAS A MOST IRRITATING AND PROVOKING LAUGH
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0081 FINALLY PETER BEGAN TO LOSE PATIENCE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0082 WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0083 HE DEMANDED CROSSLY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0084 YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT JUMPER THE HARE IS THE ONLY COUSIN I HAVE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0085 JENNY WREN LAUGHED HARDER THAT EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0086 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0087 SHE GASPED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0088 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0089 YOU WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0090 WHY DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH WHERE I SPENT THE WINTER YOU HAVE A COUSIN WHO IS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO YOU THAN JUMPER THE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0091 AND WHAT IS MORE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0092 HE IS ALMOST AS FOND OF THE WATER AS JERRY MUSKRAT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0093 HE WAS CALLED THE MARSH RABBIT OR MARSH HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0094 AND MANY A TIME I HAVE WATCHED HIM SWIMMING ABOUT BY THE HOUR
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0095 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0096 DECLARED PETER ANGRILY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0097 I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0098 YOU ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO FOOL ME JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0099 THERE NEVER WAS A RABBIT AND THERE NEVER WILL BE A RABBIT WHO WOULD GO SWIMMING FOR THE FUN OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0100 I BELONG TO THE COTTONTAIL BRANCH OF THE HARE FAMILY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0101 AND IT IS A FINE FAMILY IF I DO SAY SO
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0102 MY COUSIN JUMPER IS A TRUE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0103 AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0104 IS THAT HE IS BIGGER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0105 HAS LONGER LEGS AND EARS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0106 CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN WINTER AND SELDOM IF EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0107 GOES INTO HOLES IN THE GROUND
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0108 THE IDEA OF TRYING TO TELL ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY OWN RELATIVES
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0109 JENNY WREN SUDDENLY BECAME SOBER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0110 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0111 SAID SHE VERY EARNESTLY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0112 TAKE MY ADVICE AND GO TO SCHOOL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR AWHILE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0113 WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IS TRUE EVERY WORD OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0114 YOU HAVE A COUSIN DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0115 WHO SPENDS HALF HIS TIME IN THE WATER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0116 WHAT IS MORE I SUSPECT THAT YOU AND JUMPER HAVE OTHER RELATIVES OF WHOM YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0117 SUCH IGNORANCE WOULD BE LAUGHABLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0118 IF IT WERE NOT TO BE PITIED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0119 THIS IS WHAT COMES OF NEVER HAVING TRAVELED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0120 GO TO SCHOOL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR A WHILE PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0121 IT WILL PAY YOU
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0122 WITH THIS JENNY WREN FLEW AWAY TO HUNT FOR MR WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0123 THAT THEY MIGHT DECIDE WHERE TO MAKE THEIR HOME FOR THE SUMMER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0124 PETER TRIED TO BELIEVE WHAT JENNY WREN HAD TOLD HIM WAS NOTHING BUT A STORY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0125 BUT DO WHAT HE WOULD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0126 HE COULDN'T RID HIMSELF OF A LITTLE DOUBT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0127 HE TRIED TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE OF OLD ORCHARD BUT IT WAS USELESS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0128 THAT LITTLE DOUBT KEPT GROWING AND GROWING
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0129 COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT JENNY WREN HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0130 COULD IT BE THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVES HE HAD
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0131 OR ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0132 OF COURSE OLD MOTHER NATURE COULD TELL HIM ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0133 AND HE KNEW THAT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT TELL HIM WOULD BE TRUE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0134 FINALLY THAT GROWING DOUBT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0135 TOGETHER WITH THE CURIOSITY WHICH HAS LED POOR PETER TO DO SO MANY QUEER THINGS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0136 PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0137 AND HE STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0138 IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO FIND HER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0139 SHE WAS VERY BUSY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0140 FOR THERE IS NO TIME IN ALL THE YEAR WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE HAS QUITE SO MUCH TO DO
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0141 AS IN THE SPRING
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0142 IF YOU PLEASE OLD MOTHER NATURE SAID PETER TIMIDLY BUT VERY POLITELY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0143 I'VE SOME QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0144 OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED IN A KINDLY WAY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0145 ALL RIGHT PETER SHE REPLIED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0146 I GUESS I CAN TALK AND WORK AT THE SAME TIME
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0147 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0148 I WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE RABBIT AND THE HARE FAMILY BESIDES MY BIG COUSIN JUMPER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0149 WHO LIVES HERE IN THE GREEN FOREST
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0150 AND MYSELF
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0151 OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED MORE THAN EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0152 WHY OF COURSE PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0153 SHE REPLIED THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0154 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0155 BUT THEN I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE TRAVELED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0156 IT IS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THE VERY THINGS THEY OUGHT TO KNOW MOST ABOUT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0157 PETER LOOKED VERY HUMBLE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0158 AND AS IF HE FELT A LITTLE BIT FOOLISH
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0159 IS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0160 IS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0161 IS IT TRUE THAT WAY DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH I HAVE A COUSIN WHO LOVES TO SPEND HIS TIME IN THE WATER

ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0163 IT CERTAINLY IS PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0164 REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0165 HE IS CALLED THE MARSH RABBIT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0166 AND HE IS MORE NEARLY YOUR SIZE AND LOOKS MORE LIKE YOU
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0167 THAN ANY OF YOUR OTHER COUSINS
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0168 PETER GULPED AS IF HE WERE SWALLOWING SOMETHING THAT WENT DOWN
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0169 THAT IS WHAT JENNY WREN SAID
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0170 BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0171 REPLIED PETER MEEKLY
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0172 SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD OFTEN WATCHED HIM SWIMMING ABOUT LIKE JERRY MUSKRAT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0173 OLD MOTHER NATURE NODDED
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0174 QUITE TRUE
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0175 QUITE TRUE SAID SHE

ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0177 HE IS ONE MEMBER THE FAMILY WHO TAKES TO THE WATER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0178 AND HE CERTAINLY DOES LOVE IT
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0179 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO KNOW PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b/wav/bab.0180 PETER SHIFTED ABOUT UNEASILY AND HESITATED

ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0005 OF AN ACQUISITORIAL PROPENSITY IN ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE OCCURRED THE CONQUEST OF IRELAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0006 ANCIENTLY CALLED HIBERNIA THESE PEOPLE WERE SIMILAR TO THE BRITONS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0007 BUT OF THEIR HISTORY PRIOR TO THE YEAR FOUR
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0008 HUNDRED A D LITTLE IS KNOWN BEFORE CHRIST
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0009 A RACE OF MEN INHABITED IRELAND HOWEVER
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0010 WHO HAD THEIR OWN LITERATURE AND WHO WERE ADVANCED IN THE ARTS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0011 THIS WAS BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EARLY MASS WHISKERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0012 AND PRIOR TO THE DAYS WHEN THE ORANGEMEN HAD SENT FORTH THEIR DEFIANT PEAL
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0013 ILLUSTRATION EARLY MASS WHISKERS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY IRELAND WAS CONVERTED BY ST PATRICK
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0014 AND SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0015 TO SAY THAT SHE HAS BECOME THE ISLAND OF PUGILISTS AND POLICEMEN TO DAY WOULD BE UNJUST
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0016 AND TO SAY THAT SHE HAS MORE INFLUENCE IN AMERICA
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0017 THAN IN IRELAND WOULD BE UNKIND SURELY HER MODERN HISTORY IS MOST PATHETIC
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0018 FOR THREE CENTURIES THE ISLAND WAS HARASSED BY THE DANES AND NORTHMEN BUT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0019 WHEN THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY RULES WERE ADOPTED
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0020 THE LATTER THREW UP THE SPONGE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0021 THE FINISH FIGHT OCCURRED AT CLONTARF NEAR DUBLIN
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0022 HENRY HAD WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE POPE TO CONQUER IRELAND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE HE CARED TO DO IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0023 SOMETIMES IT RAINED AND AT OTHER TIMES HE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0024 SO THAT HIS PERMISSION GOT ALMOST WORN OUT BY CARRYING IT ABOUT WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0025 IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO HOWEVER AN IRISH CHIEF
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0026 OR SUBORDINATE KING HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS KINGDOM
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0027 DOUBTLESS BECAUSE SOME RIVAL MONARCH STEPPED IN IT AND TRACKED IT AROUND OVER THE OTHER KINGDOMS
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0028 AND SO HE CALLED UPON THE ANGLO NORMANS UNDER STRONGBOW
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0029 RICHARD DE CLARE WHOSE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0030 WAS THE FIRST THING OF THE KIND KNOWN TO CIVILIZATION FOR HELP
ductapeguy-20070619-com/wav/com0031 WHILE ASSISTING THE IRISH CHIEF STRONGBOW NOTICED A ROYAL WINK ON THE FEATURES OF HENRY

ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0010 WOODBINE TRANSFORMED THE OLD SHED AND TOOL HOUSE TO THINGS OF BEAUTY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0011 AND THE FLOWER BEDS THEMSELVES WERE THE PRETTIEST AND MOST FRAGRANT IN ALL THE COUNTRYSIDE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0012 A ROW OF DAHLIAS RAN DIRECTLY AROUND THE GARDEN SPOT DAHLIAS SCARLET GOLD AND VARIEGATED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0013 IN THE VERY CENTRE WAS A ROUND PLOT WHERE THE UPTURNED FACES OF A THOUSAND PANSIES SMILED AMID THEIR LEAVES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0014 AND IN THE FOUR CORNERS WERE TRIANGULAR BLOCKS OF SWEET PHLOX OVER WHICH THE BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERED UNCEASINGLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0015 IN THE SPACES BETWEEN RAN A RIOT OF PORTULACA AND NASTURTIUMS WHILE IN THE MORE REGULAR SHELL BORDERED BEDS

ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0044 SOMETIMES SHE USED THE BORROWED PHRASES UNCONSCIOUSLY SOMETIMES SHE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION WITH AN INTENSE SENSE OF PLEASURE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0045 IN THEIR HARMONY OR APPROPRIATENESS FOR A BEAUTIFUL WORD OR SENTENCE HAD THE SAME EFFECT UPON HER IMAGINATION

ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0112 I REMEMBER ONCE SEEING SALLY PERRY AT MEETING SHE WAS A HANDSOME GIRL AND I'M SORRY SHE'S COME TO GRIEF
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0113 IF SHE'D KEPT ON GOIN' TO MEETIN' AND HADN'T LOOKED AT THE MEN FOLKS SHE MIGHT A BEEN EARNIN' AN HONEST LIVIN' THIS MINUTE SAID MIRANDA

ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0115 UNCONSCIOUSLY REVERSING THE VERDICT OF HISTORY THEN WE OUGHT TO BE A HAPPY AND CONTENTED COMMUNITY HERE IN RIVERBORO REPLIED JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0116 AS THERE'S SIX WOMEN TO ONE MAN IF IT WAS SIXTEEN TO ONE WE'D BE ALL THE SAFER RESPONDED MIRANDA GRIMLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0117 PUTTING THE DOUGHNUTS IN A BROWN CROCK IN THE CELLAR WAY AND SLAMMING THE DOOR
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0118 THREE THE TIRED MOTHER WITH THE WEENY BABY ON HER ARM LAY ON A LONG CARPENTER'S BENCH HER EARTHLY JOURNEY OVER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0119 AND WHEN REBECCA STOLE IN AND PLACED THE FLOWERY GARLAND ALL ALONG THE EDGE OF THE RUDE BIER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0120 DEATH SUDDENLY TOOK ON A MORE GRACIOUS AND BENIGN ASPECT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0121 IT WAS ONLY A CHILD'S SYMPATHY AND INTUITION THAT SOFTENED THE RIGORS OF THE SAD MOMENT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0122 BUT POOR WILD SAL WINSLOW IN HER FRAME OF DAISIES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0123 LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE MISSED A LITTLE BY AN UNFRIENDLY WORLD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0124 WHILE THE WEENY BABY WHOSE HEART HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ALMOST AS SOON AS IT HAD LEARNED TO BEAT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0125 THE WEENY BABY WITH EMMA JANE'S NOSEGAY OF BUTTERCUPS IN ITS TINY WRINKLED HAND SMILED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0126 AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVED AND LONGED FOR AND MOURNED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0127 WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN NOW WITHOUT A MINISTER WHISPERED REBECCA
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0128 WE COULD SING GOD IS EVER GOOD OUT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL SONG BOOK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0129 BUT I'M AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD HEAR US AND THINK WE WERE GAY AND HAPPY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0130 WHAT'S THAT A STRANGE SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS A GURGLE A YAWN A MERRY LITTLE CALL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0131 THE TWO GIRLS RAN IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT CAME AND THERE ON AN OLD COAT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0132 IN A CLUMP OF GOLDENROD BUSHES LAY A CHILD JUST WAKING FROM A REFRESHING NAP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0133 IT'S THE OTHER BABY THAT LIZY ANN DENNETT TOLD ABOUT CRIED EMMA JANE ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0134 EXCLAIMED REBECCA COME STRAIGHT TO ME AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0135 THE CHILD STRUGGLED TO ITS FEET AND TOTTERED WAVERING TOWARD THE WARM WELCOME OF THE VOICE AND EYES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0136 REBECCA WAS ALL MOTHER AND HER MATERNAL INSTINCTS HAD BEEN WELL DEVELOPED IN THE LARGE FAMILY IN WHICH SHE WAS NEXT TO THE ELDEST
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0137 SHE HAD ALWAYS CONFESSED THAT THERE WERE PERHAPS A TRIFLE TOO MANY BABIES AT SUNNYBROOK FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0138 BUT NEVERTHELESS HAD SHE EVER HEARD IT SHE WOULD HAVE STOOD LOYALLY BY THE JAPANESE PROVERB
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0139 WHETHER BROUGHT FORTH UPON THE MOUNTAIN OR IN THE FIELD IT MATTERS NOTHING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0140 MORE THAN A TREASURE OF ONE THOUSAND RYO A BABY PRECIOUS IS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0141 YOU DARLING THING SHE CROONED AS SHE CAUGHT AND LIFTED THE CHILD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0142 YOU LOOK JUST LIKE A JACK O LANTERN THE BOY WAS CLAD IN A YELLOW COTTON DRESS VERY FULL AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0143 STIFF HIS HAIR WAS OF SUCH A BRIGHT GOLD AND SO SLEEK AND SHINY THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0144 FAIR SMOOTH LITTLE PUMPKIN HE HAD WIDE BLUE EYES FULL OF LAUGHTER A NEAT LITTLE VERTICAL NOSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0145 A NEAT LITTLE HORIZONTAL MOUTH WITH HIS FEW NEAT LITTLE TEETH SHOWING VERY PLAINLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0146 AND ON THE WHOLE REBECCA'S FIGURE OF SPEECH WAS NOT SO WIDE OF THE MARK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0147 OH EMMA JANE ISN'T HE TOO LOVELY TO GO TO THE POOR FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0148 IF ONLY WE WERE MARRIED WE COULD KEEP HIM AND SAY NOTHING AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0149 NOW THAT THE SIMPSONS HAVE GONE AWAY THERE ISN'T A SINGLE BABY IN RIVERBORO AND ONLY ONE IN EDGEWOOD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0150 IT'S A PERFECT SHAME BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0151 YOU REMEMBER AUNT MIRANDA WOULDN'T LET ME HAVE THE SIMPSON BABY WHEN I WANTED TO BORROW HER JUST FOR ONE RAINY SUNDAY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0152 MY MOTHER WON'T KEEP HIM SO IT'S NO USE TO ASK HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0153 SHE SAYS MOST EVERY DAY SHE'S GLAD WE'RE GROWN UP AND SHE THANKS THE LORD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0154 THERE WASN'T BUT TWO OF US AND MRS PETER MESERVE IS TOO NERVOUS REBECCA WENT ON TAKING THE VILLAGE HOUSES IN TURN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0155 AND MRS ROBINSON IS TOO NEAT PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO LIKE ANY BUT THEIR OWN BABIES OBSERVED EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0156 WELL I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT REBECCA ANSWERED A BABY'S A BABY I SHOULD THINK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0157 WHOSE EVER IT IS MISS DEARBORN IS COMING BACK MONDAY I WONDER IF SHE'D LIKE IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0158 SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO OUT OF SCHOOL AND WE COULD BORROW IT ALL THE TIME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0159 I DON'T THINK IT WOULD SEEM VERY GENTEEL FOR A YOUNG LADY LIKE MISS DEARBORN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0160 WHO BOARDS ROUND TO TAKE A BABY FROM PLACE TO PLACE OBJECTED EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0161 PERHAPS NOT AGREED REBECCA DESPONDENTLY BUT I THINK IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ANY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0162 PRIVATE BABIES IN RIVERBORO WE OUGHT TO HAVE ONE FOR THE TOWN AND ALL HAVE A SHARE IN IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0163 WE'VE GOT A TOWN HALL AND A TOWN LAMP POST AND A TOWN WATERING TROUGH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0164 THINGS ARE SO UNEVEN ONE HOUSE LIKE MINE AT SUNNYBROOK BRIMFUL OF CHILDREN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0165 AND THE VERY NEXT ONE EMPTY THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THEM RIGHT WOULD BE TO LET ALL THE BABIES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0166 THAT EVER ARE BELONG TO ALL THE GROWN UP PEOPLE THAT EVER ARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0167 JUST DIVIDE THEM UP YOU KNOW IF THEY'D GO ROUND OH I HAVE A THOUGHT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0168 DON'T YOU BELIEVE AUNT SARAH COBB WOULD KEEP HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0169 SHE CARRIES FLOWERS TO THE GRAVEYARD EVERY LITTLE WHILE AND ONCE SHE TOOK ME WITH HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0170 THERE'S A MARBLE CROSS AND IT SAYS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0171 SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF SARAH ELLEN BELOVED CHILD OF SARAH AND JEREMIAH COBB AGED SEVENTEEN MONTHS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0172 WHY THAT'S ANOTHER REASON MRS DENNETT SAYS THIS ONE IS SEVENTEEN MONTHS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0173 THERE'S FIVE OF US LEFT AT THE FARM WITHOUT ME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0174 BUT IF WE WERE ONLY NEARER TO RIVERBORO HOW QUICK MOTHER WOULD LET IN ONE MORE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0175 WE MIGHT SEE WHAT FATHER THINKS AND THAT WOULD SETTLE IT SAID EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0176 FATHER DOESN'T THINK VERY SUDDEN BUT HE THINKS AWFUL STRONG
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0177 IF WE DON'T BOTHER HIM AND FIND A PLACE OURSELVES FOR THE BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0178 PERHAPS HE'LL BE WILLING HE'S COMING NOW I HEAR THE WHEELS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0179 LIZY ANN DENNETT VOLUNTEERED TO STAY AND PERFORM THE LAST RITES WITH THE UNDERTAKER AND JACK O LANTERN WITH HIS SLENDER WARDROBE TIED IN A BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0180 WAS LIFTED INTO THE WAGON BY THE RELUCTANT MR PERKINS AND JUBILANTLY HELD BY REBECCA IN HER LAP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0181 MR PERKINS DROVE OFF AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0182 BEING HEARTILY SICK OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND THINKING WISELY THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS HAD ALREADY SEEN AND HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THE SEAMY SIDE OF LIFE THAT MORNING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0183 DISCUSSION CONCERNING JACK O LANTERN'S FUTURE WAS PRUDENTLY DEFERRED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0184 AND THEN MR PERKINS WAS MERCILESSLY PELTED WITH ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE CHOICE OF THE POOR FARM AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR A BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0185 HIS FATHER IS SURE TO COME BACK SOME TIME MR PERKINS URGED REBECCA
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0186 HE COULDN'T LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL THING FOREVER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0187 AND IF EMMA JANE AND I CAN PERSUADE MRS COBB TO KEEP HIM A LITTLE WHILE WOULD YOU CARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0188 NO ON REFLECTION MR PERKINS DID NOT CARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0189 HE MERELY WANTED A QUIET LIFE AND ENOUGH TIME LEFT OVER FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO ATTEND TO HIS BLACKSMITH'S SHOP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0190 SO INSTEAD OF GOING HOME OVER THE SAME ROAD BY WHICH THEY CAME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0191 HE CROSSED THE BRIDGE INTO EDGEWOOD AND DROPPED THE CHILDREN AT THE LONG LANE WHICH LED TO THE COBB HOUSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0192 MRS COBB AUNT SARAH TO THE WHOLE VILLAGE SAT BY THE WINDOW LOOKING FOR UNCLE JERRY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0193 WHO WOULD SOON BE SEEN DRIVING THE NOON STAGE TO THE POST OFFICE OVER THE HILL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0194 SHE ALWAYS HAD AN EYE OUT FOR REBECCA TOO
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0195 FOR EVER SINCE THE CHILD HAD BEEN A PASSENGER ON MR COBB'S STAGECOACH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0196 MAKING THE EVENTFUL TRIP FROM HER HOME FARM TO THE BRICK HOUSE IN RIVERBORO IN HIS COMPANY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0197 SHE HAD BEEN A CONSTANT VISITOR AND THE JOY OF THE QUIET HOUSEHOLD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0198 EMMA JANE TOO WAS A WELL KNOWN FIGURE IN THE LANE BUT THE STRANGE BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0199 WAS IN THE NATURE OF A SURPRISE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0200 A SURPRISE SOMEWHAT MODIFIED BY THE FACT THAT REBECCA WAS A DRAMATIC PERSONAGE AND MORE LIABLE TO APPEAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURIOUS OUTRIDERS COMRADES AND RETAINERS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0201 THAN THE ORDINARY RIVERBORO CHILD SHE HAD RUN AWAY FROM THE TOO STERN DISCIPLINE OF THE BRICK HOUSE ON ONE OCCASION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0202 AND HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO RETURN BY UNCLE JERRY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0203 SHE HAD ESCORTED A WANDERING ORGAN GRINDER TO THEIR DOOR AND BEGGED A LODGING FOR HIM ON A RAINY NIGHT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0204 SO ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS NOTHING AMAZING ABOUT THE COMING PROCESSION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0205 THE LITTLE PARTY TOILED UP TO THE HOSPITABLE DOOR AND MRS COBB CAME OUT TO MEET THEM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0206 REBECCA WAS SPOKESMAN EMMA JANE'S TALENT DID NOT LIE IN ELOQUENT SPEECH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0207 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VALIANT AND A FLUENT CHILD INDEED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0208 WHO COULD HAVE USURPED REBECCA'S PRIVILEGES AND TENDENCIES IN THIS DIRECTION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0209 LANGUAGE BEING HER NATIVE ELEMENT AND WORDS OF ASSORTED SIZES SPRINGING SPONTANEOUSLY TO HER LIPS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0210 AUNT SARAH DEAR SHE SAID PLUMPING JACK O LANTERN DOWN ON THE GRASS AS SHE PULLED HIS DRESS OVER HIS FEET AND SMOOTHED HIS HAIR BECOMINGLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0211 WILL YOU PLEASE NOT SAY A WORD TILL I GET THROUGH AS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU ANSWER YES OR NO
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0212 THIS IS A BABY NAMED JACKY WINSLOW AND I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE A JACK O LANTERN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0213 HIS MOTHER HAS JUST DIED OVER TO NORTH RIVERBORO ALL ALONE EXCEPTING FOR MRS LIZY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0214 ANN DENNETT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0215 AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE WEENY BABY THAT DIED WITH HER AND EMMA JANE AND I PUT FLOWERS AROUND THEM AND DID THE BEST WE COULD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0216 THE FATHER THAT'S JOHN WINSLOW QUARRELED WITH THE MOTHER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0217 THAT WAS SAL PERRY ON THE MODERATION ROAD AND RAN AWAY AND LEFT HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0218 SO HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS WIFE AND THE WEENY BABY ARE DEAD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0219 AND THE TOWN HAS GOT TO BURY THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND THE FATHER RIGHT OFF QUICK AND JACKY HAS GOT TO GO TO THE POOR FARM THIS AFTERNOON AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0220 IT SEEMS AN AWFUL SHAME TO TAKE HIM UP TO THAT LONESOME PLACE WITH THOSE OLD PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AMUSE HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0221 AND IF EMMA JANE AND ALICE ROBINSON AND I TAKE MOST ALL THE CARE OF HIM WE THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU AND UNCLE JERRY WOULD KEEP HIM JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0222 YOU'VE GOT A COW AND A TURN UP BEDSTEAD YOU KNOW SHE HURRIED ON INSINUATINGLY AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0223 THERE'S HARDLY ANY PLEASURE AS CHEAP AS MORE BABIES WHERE THERE'S EVER BEEN ANY BEFORE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0224 FOR BABY CARRIAGES AND TRUNDLE BEDS AND CRADLES DON'T WEAR OUT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0225 AND THERE'S ALWAYS CLOTHES LEFT OVER FROM THE OLD BABY TO BEGIN THE NEW ONE ON
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0226 OF COURSE WE CAN COLLECT ENOUGH THINGS TO START JACKY SO HE WON'T BE MUCH TROUBLE OR EXPENSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0227 AND ANYWAY HE'S PAST THE MOST TROUBLESOME AGE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE UP NIGHTS WITH HIM AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0228 HE ISN'T AFRAID OF ANYBODY OR ANYTHING AS YOU CAN SEE BY HIS JUST SITTING THERE LAUGHING AND SUCKING HIS THUMB
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0229 THOUGH HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0230 AND HE'S JUST SEVENTEEN MONTHS OLD LIKE DEAR LITTLE SARAH ELLEN IN THE GRAVEYARD AND WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE REFUSAL OF HIM BEFORE HE GOES TO THE POOR FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0231 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0232 BECAUSE IT'S NEAR MY DINNER TIME AND AUNT MIRANDA WILL KEEP ME IN THE WHOLE AFTERNOON IF I'M LATE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr/wav/chr0233 AND I'VE GOT TO FINISH WEEDING THE HOLLYHOCK BED BEFORE SUNDOWN

ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0004 GENESIS SIXTEEN ONE TO SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0005 YOU REMEMBER ABRAM'S WIFE WHO HAD JOURNEYED WITH HIM FROM UR OF THE CHALDEES AND WHO LIVED IN HIS TENT ALL THOSE YEARS WAS NAMED SARAI
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0006 NOW SARAI HAD A MAID A SERVANT THAT WAITED ON HER WHOSE NAME WAS HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0007 SHE CAME FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT WHERE WERE THE PYRAMIDS AND THE TEMPLES
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0008 BUT SARAI AND HER MAID HAGAR HAD SOME TROUBLE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0009 THEY COULD NOT AGREE AND SARAI WAS SO SHARP AND SEVERE WITH HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0010 THAT AT LAST HAGAR RAN AWAY FROM SARAI'S TENT
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0011 SHE WENT OUT INTO THE DESERT AND TOOK THE ROAD THAT LED DOWN TO EGYPT HER OWN COUNTRY
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0012 THE LAND FROM WHICH SHE HAD COME ON THE WAY SHE STOPPED BESIDE A SPRING OF WATER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0013 THERE AN ANGEL FROM THE LORD MET HER AND SAID TO HER HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0014 ARE YOU NOT THE SERVANT OF SARAI ABRAM'S WIFE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0015 WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND HAGAR SAID TO THE ANGEL
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0016 I AM GOING AWAY FROM MY MISTRESS SARAI BECAUSE I DO NOT WISH TO STAY WITH HER AND SERVE HER ANY LONGER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0017 THEN THE ANGEL SAID TO HAGAR GO BACK TO YOUR MISTRESS SARAI AND SUBMIT TO HER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0018 FOR IT IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN TO GO AWAY
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0019 GOD KNOWS ALL YOUR TROUBLES FOR HE SEES YOU AND HEARS YOU AND HE WILL HELP YOU
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0020 BY AND BY YOU SHALL HAVE A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISHMAEL BECAUSE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0021 GOD HAS HEARD YOU THE WORD ISHMAEL MEANS GOD HEARS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0022 SO WHENEVER HAGAR SHOULD SPEAK HER BOY'S NAME SHE WOULD THINK GOD HAS HEARD ME
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0023 THEN THE ANGEL TOLD HAGAR THAT HER SON ISHMAEL SHOULD BE STRONG AND FIERCE AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERCOME HIM OR HIS CHILDREN
ductapeguy-20080423-ang/wav/sto0024 OR HIS DESCENDANTS THOSE WHO SHOULD COME AFTER HIM SO HAGAR WAS COMFORTED

ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0004 FIRST SAMUEL SEVEN ONE TO FIFTY FOUR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0005 ALL THROUGH THE REIGN OF SAUL THERE WAS CONSTANT WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES WHO LIVED UPON THE LOWLANDS WEST OF ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0006 AT ONE TIME WHEN DAVID WAS STILL WITH HIS SHEEP A FEW YEARS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ANOINTED BY SAMUEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0007 THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND THE ISRAELITES WERE SET
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0008 AGAINST EACH OTHER ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE VALLEY OF ELAH READY TO FIGHT EACH OTHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0009 IN THE ARMY OF ISRAEL WERE THE THREE OLDEST BROTHERS OF DAVID WHO WERE SOLDIERS UNDER KING SAUL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0010 EVERY DAY A GIANT CAME OUT OF THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND DARED SOME ONE TO COME FROM THE ISRAELITES' CAMP AND FIGHT WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0011 THE GIANT'S NAME WAS GOLIATH HE WAS NINE FEET HIGH AND HE WORE ARMOR FROM HEAD TO FOOT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0012 AND CARRIED A SPEAR TWICE AS LONG AND AS HEAVY AS ANY OTHER MAN COULD HOLD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0013 AND HIS SHIELD BEARER WALKED BEFORE HIM HE CAME EVERY DAY AND CALLED OUT ACROSS THE LITTLE VALLEY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0014 I AM A PHILISTINE AND YOU ARE SERVANTS OF SAUL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0015 NOW CHOOSE ONE OF YOUR MEN AND LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT WITH ME
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0016 IF I KILL HIM THEN YOU SHALL SUBMIT TO US AND IF HE KILLS ME
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0017 THEN WE WILL GIVE UP TO YOU COME NOW SEND OUT YOUR MAN
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0018 BUT NO MAN IN THE ARMY NOT EVEN KING SAUL DARED TO GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH THE GIANT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0019 THE ISRAELITES WERE MOSTLY FARMERS AND SHEPHERDS AND WERE NOT FOND OF WAR AS WERE THE PHILISTINES
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0020 THEN TOO VERY FEW OF THE ISRAELITES HAD SWORDS AND SPEARS EXCEPT SUCH RUDE WEAPONS AS THEY COULD MAKE OUT OF THEIR FARMING TOOLS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0021 FORTY DAYS THE CAMPS STOOD AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE PHILISTINE GIANT CONTINUED HIS CALL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0022 ONE DAY OLD JESSE THE FATHER OF DAVID SENT DAVID FROM BETHLEHEM TO VISIT HIS THREE BROTHERS IN THE ARMY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0023 DAVID CAME SPOKE TO HIS BROTHERS AND GAVE THEM A PRESENT FROM HIS FATHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0024 WHILE HE WAS TALKING WITH THEM GOLIATH THE GIANT CAME OUT AS BEFORE IN FRONT OF THE CAMP
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0025 CALLING FOR SOME ONE TO FIGHT WITH HIM THE ISRAELITES SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0026 IF ANY MAN WILL GO OUT AND KILL THIS PHILISTINE THE KING WILL GIVE HIM A GREAT REWARD AND A HIGH RANK
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0027 AND THE KINGS' DAUGHTER SHALL BE HIS WIFE AND DAVID SAID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0028 WHO IS THIS MAN THAT SPEAKS IN THIS PROUD MANNER AGAINST THE ARMIES OF THE LIVING GOD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0029 WHY DOES NOT SOME ONE GO OUT AND KILL HIM DAVID'S BROTHER ELIAB SAID TO HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0030 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE LEAVING YOUR SHEEP IN THE FIELD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0031 I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE COME DOWN JUST TO SEE THE BATTLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0032 BUT DAVID DID NOT CARE FOR HIS BROTHER'S ANGRY WORDS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0033 HE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO KILL THIS BOASTING GIANT WHILE ALL THE MEN WERE IN TERROR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0034 THIS BOY THOUGHT OF A PLAN HE BELIEVED THAT HE KNEW HOW TO BRING DOWN THE BIG WARRIOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0035 WITH ALL HIS ARMOR FINALLY DAVID SAID IF NO ONE ELSE WILL GO
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0036 I WILL GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH THIS ENEMY OF THE LORD'S PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0037 THEY BROUGHT DAVID BEFORE KING SAUL SOME YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE SAUL HAD MET DAVID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0038 AND HE HAD GROWN FROM A BOY TO A MAN
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0039 SO THAT SAUL DID NOT KNOW HIM AS THE SHEPHERD WHO HAD PLAYED ON THE HARP BEFORE HIM IN OTHER DAYS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0040 SAUL SAID TO DAVID YOU CANNOT FIGHT WITH THIS GIANT YOU ARE VERY YOUNG AND HE IS A MAN OF WAR TRAINED FROM HIS YOUTH
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0041 AND DAVID ANSWERED KING SAUL I
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0042 AM ONLY A SHEPHERD BUT I HAVE FOUGHT WITH LIONS AND BEARS WHEN THEY HAVE TRIED TO STEAL MY SHEEP
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0043 AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT WITH THIS PHILISTINE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0044 THE LORD SAVED ME FROM THE LION'S JAW AND THE BEAR'S PAW
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0045 AND HE WILL SAVE ME FROM THIS ENEMY FOR I SHALL FIGHT FOR THE LORD AND HIS PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0046 THEN SAUL PUT HIS OWN ARMOR ON DAVID A HELMET ON HIS HEAD AND A COAT OF MAIL ON HIS BODY AND A SWORD AT HIS WAIST
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0047 BUT SAUL WAS ALMOST A GIANT AND HIS ARMOR WAS FAR TOO LARGE FOR DAVID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0048 DAVID SAID I AM NOT USED TO FIGHTING WITH SUCH WEAPONS AS THESE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0049 LET ME FIGHT IN MY OWN WAY SO DAVID TOOK OFF SAUL'S ARMOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0050 FOR DAVID'S PLAN TO FIGHT THE GIANT DID NOT NEED AN ARMOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0051 BUT DID NEED A QUICK EYE A CLEAR HEAD A SURE AIM AND A BOLD HEART
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0052 AND ALL THESE DAVID HAD FOR GOD HAD GIVEN THEM TO HIM DAVID'S PLAN WAS VERY WISE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0053 IT WAS TO MAKE GOLIATH THINK THAT HIS ENEMY WAS TOO WEAK FOR HIM TO BE ON HIS GUARD AGAINST HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0054 AND WHILE SO FAR AWAY THAT THE GIANT COULD NOT REACH HIM WITH SWORD OR SPEAR TO STRIKE HIM DOWN WITH A WEAPON WHICH THE GIANT WOULD NOT EXPECT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0055 AND WOULD NOT BE PREPARED FOR DAVID TOOK HIS SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0056 AS THOUGH THAT WERE TO BE HIS WEAPON
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0057 BUT OUT OF SIGHT IN A BAG UNDER HIS MANTLE HE HAD FIVE SMOOTH STONES CAREFULLY CHOSEN AND A SLING
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0058 THE WEAPON HE KNEW HOW TO USE THEN HE CAME OUT TO MEET THE PHILISTINE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0059 THE GIANT LOOKED DOWN ON THE YOUTH AND DESPISED HIM AND LAUGHED AT HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0060 AM I A DOG HE SAID THAT THIS BOY COMES TO ME WITH A STAFF
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0061 I WILL GIVE HIS BODY TO THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0062 AND THE PHILISTINE CURSED DAVID BY THE GODS OF HIS PEOPLE AND DAVID ANSWERED HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0063 YOU COME AGAINST ME WITH A SWORD AND A SPEAR AND A DART
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0064 BUT I COME TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF THE ARMIES OF ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0065 THIS DAY WILL THE LORD GIVE YOU INTO MY HAND I WILL STRIKE YOU DOWN AND TAKE OFF YOUR HEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0066 AND THE HOST OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL BE DEAD BODIES TO BE EATEN BY THE BIRDS AND THE BEASTS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0067 SO THAT ALL MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD IN ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0068 AND THAT HE CAN SAVE IN OTHER WAYS BESIDES WITH SWORD AND SPEAR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0069 AND DAVID RAN TOWARD THE PHILISTINE AS IF TO FIGHT HIM WITH HIS SHEPHERD'S STAFF
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0070 BUT WHEN HE WAS JUST NEAR ENOUGH FOR A GOOD AIM HE TOOK OUT HIS SLING AND HURLED A STONE AIMED AT THE GIANT'S FOREHEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0071 DAVID'S AIM WAS GOOD THE STONE STRUCK THE PHILISTINE IN HIS FOREHEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0072 IT STUNNED HIM AND HE FELL TO THE GROUND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0073 WHILE THE TWO ARMIES STOOD WONDERING AND SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT HAD CAUSED THE GIANT TO FALL SO SUDDENLY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0074 DAVID RAN FORWARD DREW OUT THE GIANT'S OWN SWORD AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0075 THEN THE PHILISTINES KNEW THAT THEIR GREAT WARRIOR IN WHOM THEY TRUSTED WAS DEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0076 THEY TURNED TO FLY BACK TO THEIR OWN LAND AND THE ISRAELITES FOLLOWED AFTER THEM AND KILLED THEM BY THE HUNDRED AND THOUSAND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0077 EVEN TO THE GATES OF THEIR OWN CITY OF GATH
ductapeguy-20080423-sto/wav/sto0078 SO IN THAT DAY DAVID WON A GREAT VICTORY AND STOOD BEFORE ALL THE LAND AS THE ONE WHO HAD SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR ENEMIES

eboyjr-20090725-brf/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
eboyjr-20090725-brf/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
eboyjr-20090725-brf/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
eboyjr-20090725-cye/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
eboyjr-20090725-fov/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
eboyjr-20090725-hqr/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
eboyjr-20090725-mvs/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
eboyjr-20090725-nmh/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
eboyjr-20090725-nur/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
eboyjr-20090725-ree/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
eboyjr-20090725-ywy/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
eddiea25-20090112-ybo/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Edman274-20090103-fja/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
Edman274-20090103-fmy/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
Edman274-20090103-vga/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
edman274-20090116-qws/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
edman274-20090116-qws/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
edman274-20090116-qws/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
edman274-20090116-qws/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED

Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
Edman274-20090511-cxp/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
Edman274-20091113-qfw/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE

Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
Eresus-20090416-ked/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
Eresus-20090416-zdx/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
Eresus-20090416-zdx/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
Eresus-20090416-zdx/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
Eresus-20090416-zdx/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS

ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED

ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE

ethanoconnors-20080607-guk/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN

ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
ETT-20090329-typ/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK

farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
farmerjack-20080828-dxa/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
farmerjack-20080828-fja/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
farmerjack-20080828-ghi/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
farmerjack-20080828-jcm/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
farmerjack-20080828-jrq/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
farmerjack-20080828-jvp/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
farmerjack-20080828-mpc/wav/b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
farmerjack-20080828-omz/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
farmerjack-20080828-pqo/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
farmerjack-20080828-pyl/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
farmerjack-20080828-qvk/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
farmerjack-20080828-qzo/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
farmerjack-20080828-sgh/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
farmerjack-20080828-ste/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
farmerjack-20080828-tem/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
farmerjack-20080828-tqf/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
farmerjack-20080828-vqx/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
farmerjack-20080828-xeh/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
farmerjack-20080828-yhk/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
farmerjack-20080828-yxa/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
farmerjack-20080829-ctp/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
farmerjack-20080829-dif/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
farmerjack-20080829-eao/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
farmerjack-20080829-gfl/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
farmerjack-20080829-gfl/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN

farmerjack-20080829-gfl/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
farmerjack-20080829-gfl/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
farmerjack-20080829-gfl/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION

farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
farmerjack-20080829-iju/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
farmerjack-20080829-jgz/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
farmerjack-20080829-jrg/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
farmerjack-20080829-lbh/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
farmerjack-20080829-lzb/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL

farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
farmerjack-20080829-pby/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
farmerjack-20080829-qcz/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
farmerjack-20080829-yqz/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
farmerjack-20080830-dzr/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
farmerjack-20080830-rqn/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
farmerjack-20080830-ymd/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
farmerjack-20080830-yqs/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
farmerjack-20080831-wqm/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
farmerjack-20080915-aeh/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
farmerjack-20080915-byh/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST

farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
farmerjack-20080915-crj/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
farmerjack-20080915-fhs/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
farmerjack-20080915-hzx/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
farmerjack-20080915-jzs/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
farmerjack-20080915-khz/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
farmerjack-20080915-knl/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
farmerjack-20080915-knl/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
farmerjack-20080915-knl/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
farmerjack-20080915-knl/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID

farmerjack-20080915-knl/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER

farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO

farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
farmerjack-20080915-lws/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
farmerjack-20080915-nhr/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
farmerjack-20080915-nhr/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER

farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
farmerjack-20080915-opn/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
farmerjack-20080915-paf/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
farmerjack-20080915-pki/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
farmerjack-20080915-qof/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
farmerjack-20080915-rea/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
farmerjack-20080915-tey/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
farmerjack-20080915-tni/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
farmerjack-20080915-tvt/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
farmerjack-20080915-txy/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
farmerjack-20080915-uel/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
farmerjack-20080915-uhr/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
farmerjack-20080915-umg/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
farmerjack-20080915-usr/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
farmerjack-20080915-voq/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
farmerjack-20080915-xbp/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
farmerjack-20080915-xju/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
farmerjack-20080915-yfk/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
farmerjack-20080915-yjg/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
farmerjack-20080915-zfv/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S

farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER

farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
farmerjack-20080915-zqg/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION

farmerjack-20080917-agt/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
farmerjack-20080917-agt/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
farmerjack-20080917-apb/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
farmerjack-20080917-apb/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
farmerjack-20080917-apb/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE

farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
farmerjack-20080917-dek/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
farmerjack-20080917-ejj/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY

farmerjack-20080917-ejj/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
farmerjack-20080917-ejj/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
farmerjack-20080917-ejj/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
farmerjack-20080917-fxy/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
farmerjack-20080917-fxy/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
farmerjack-20080917-fxy/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY

farmerjack-20080917-fxy/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
farmerjack-20080917-fxy/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS

farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
farmerjack-20080917-gzj/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES

farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR

farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
farmerjack-20080917-ohx/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
farmerjack-20080917-onw/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
farmerjack-20080917-qkz/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
farmerjack-20080917-taj/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
farmerjack-20080917-uem/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
farmerjack-20080917-wrw/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
farmerjack-20080917-xab/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
farmerjack-20080918-afe/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
farmerjack-20080918-dat/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
farmerjack-20080918-dmj/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
farmerjack-20080918-eiy/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
farmerjack-20080918-els/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
farmerjack-20080918-eyl/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
farmerjack-20080918-gka/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
farmerjack-20080918-jbx/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
farmerjack-20080918-ncj/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
farmerjack-20080918-rkj/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
farmerjack-20080918-rze/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
farmerjack-20080918-uwr/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
farmerjack-20080918-wbt/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
farmerjack-20080918-xtb/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
farmerjack-20080918-ynk/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
farmerjack-20080918-yzm/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
fate-20090311-osp/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
fate-20090311-urp/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
fatmav-20090703-jku/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
framerjack-20080915-pit/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0247 TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
francishemingway-20090606-dvk/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER

francishemingway-20090606-fyf/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
francishemingway-20090606-fyf/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
francishemingway-20090606-fyf/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
francishemingway-20090606-fyf/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
francishemingway-20090606-fyf/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC
francishemingway-20090606-xxd/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
francishemingway-20090606-zcq/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE

FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY

FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
FrankdeLange-20080718-xkd/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
FrankdeLange-20080718-zto/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
FrozenFire-20080827-bnh/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
FrozenFire-20080827-dcw/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
FrozenFire-20080827-gqa/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
FrozenFire-20080827-juh/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
FrozenFire-20080827-kvl/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
FrozenFire-20080827-mij/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
FrozenFire-20080827-mkg/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
FrozenFire-20080827-qpg/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
FrozenFire-20080827-qzs/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
FrozenFire-20080827-xbz/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
FrozenFire-20080827-yeq/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
G-20080425-itf/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH

G-20080425-itf/wav/b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
G-20080425-itf/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION

galalleni-20090316-cvo/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
galalleni-20090316-djq/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
galalleni-20090316-qiv/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
galalleni-20090316-rnp/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE

galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
galalleni-20090316-wos/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE

geh_weida-20090413-zaq/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
geh_weida-20090413-zaq/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
geh_weida-20090413-zaq/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
geh_weida-20090413-zaq/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES

gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0004 CHAPTER ONE THE LETTER I HAVE READ OF MEN WHO WHEN FORCED BY THEIR CALLING TO LIVE FOR LONG PERIODS IN UTTER SOLITUDE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0005 SAVE FOR A FEW BLACK FACES HAVE MADE IT A RULE TO DRESS REGULARLY FOR DINNER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR SELF RESPECT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0006 AND PREVENT A RELAPSE INTO BARBARISM IT WAS IN SOME SUCH SPIRIT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0007 WITH AN ADDED TOUCH OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING OF TWENTY THIRD SEPTEMBER IN A RECENT YEAR
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0008 I WAS MAKING MY EVENING TOILET IN MY CHAMBERS IN PALL MALL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0009 I THOUGHT THE DATE AND THE PLACE JUSTIFIED THE PARALLEL TO MY ADVANTAGE EVEN
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0010 FOR THE OBSCURE BURMESE ADMINISTRATOR MIGHT WELL BE A MAN OF BLUNTED SENSIBILITIES AND COARSE FIBRE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0011 AND AT LEAST HE IS ALONE WITH NATURE WHILE I WELL A YOUNG MAN OF CONDITION AND FASHION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0012 WHO KNOWS THE RIGHT PEOPLE BELONGS TO THE RIGHT CLUBS HAS A SAFE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0013 POSSIBLY A BRILLIANT FUTURE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE MAY BE EXCUSED FOR A SENSE OF COMPLACENT MARTYRDOM
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0014 WHEN WITH HIS KEEN APPRECIATION OF THE SOCIAL CALENDAR HE IS DOOMED TO THE OUTER SOLITUDE OF LONDON IN SEPTEMBER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0015 I SAY MARTYRDOM BUT IN FACT THE CASE WAS INFINITELY WORSE FOR TO FEEL ONESELF A MARTYR
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0016 AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IS A PLEASURABLE THING AND THE TRUE TRAGEDY OF MY POSITION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0017 WAS THAT I HAD PASSED THAT STAGE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0018 I HAD ENJOYED WHAT SWEETS IT HAD TO OFFER IN EVER DWINDLING DEGREE SINCE THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0019 WHEN TIES WERE STILL FRESH AND SYMPATHY ABUNDANT I HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0020 THAT I WAS MISSED AT MORVEN LODGE PARTY LADY ASHLEIGH HERSELF HAD SAID SO IN THE KINDEST POSSIBLE MANNER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0021 WHEN SHE WROTE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LETTER IN WHICH I EXPLAINED WITH AN EFFECTIVELY AUSTERE RESERVE OF LANGUAGE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0022 THAT CIRCUMSTANCES COMPELLED ME TO REMAIN AT MY OFFICE WE KNOW HOW BUSY YOU MUST BE JUST NOW
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0023 SHE WROTE AND I DO HOPE YOU WON'T OVERWORK WE SHALL ALL MISS YOU VERY MUCH
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0024 FRIEND AFTER FRIEND GOT AWAY TO SPORT AND FRESH AIR WITH PROMISES TO WRITE AND CHAFFING CONDOLENCES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0025 AND AS EACH DESERTED THE SINKING SHIP I TOOK A GRIM DELIGHT IN MY MISERY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0026 POSITIVELY ALMOST ENJOYING THE FIRST WEEK OR TWO AFTER MY WORLD HAD BEEN FINALLY DISSIPATED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0027 TO THE FOUR BRACING WINDS OF HEAVEN I BEGAN TO TAKE A SPURIOUS INTEREST IN THE REMAINING FIVE MILLIONS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0028 AND WROTE SEVERAL CLEVER LETTERS IN A VEIN OF CHEAP SATIRE INDIRECTLY SUGGESTING THE PATHOS OF MY POSITION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0029 BUT INDICATING THAT I WAS BROAD MINDED ENOUGH TO FIND INTELLECTUAL ENTERTAINMENT IN THE SCENES PERSONS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0030 AND HABITS OF LONDON IN THE DEAD SEASON I EVEN DID RATIONAL THINGS AT THE INSTIGATION OF OTHERS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0031 FOR THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TOTAL ISOLATION BEST
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0032 I OF COURSE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SEDIMENT OF UNFORTUNATES LIKE MYSELF WHO UNLIKE ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0033 VIEWED THE SITUATION IN A MOST PROSAIC LIGHT THERE WERE RIVER EXCURSIONS AND SO ON AFTER OFFICE HOURS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0034 BUT I DISLIKE THE RIVER AT ANY TIME FOR ITS NOISY VULGARITY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0035 AND MOST OF ALL AT THIS SEASON SO I DROPPED OUT OF THE FRESH AIR BRIGADE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0036 AND DECLINED HIS OFFER TO SHARE A RIVERSIDE COTTAGE AND RUN UP TO TOWN IN THE MORNINGS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0037 I DID SPEND ONE OR TWO WEEK ENDS WITH THE CATESBYS IN KENT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0038 BUT I WAS NOT INCONSOLABLE WHEN THEY LET THEIR HOUSE AND WENT ABROAD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0039 FOR I FOUND THAT SUCH PARTIAL COMPENSATIONS DID NOT SUIT ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0040 NEITHER DID THE TASTE FOR SATIRICAL OBSERVATION LAST A PASSING THIRST WHICH I DARE SAY MANY HAVE SHARED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0041 FOR ADVENTURES OF THE FASCINATING KIND DESCRIBED IN THE NEW ARABIAN NIGHTS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0042 LED ME ON A FEW EVENINGS INTO SOME SHADY HAUNTS IN SOHO AND FARTHER EASTWARD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0043 BUT WAS FINALLY QUENCHED ONE SULTRY SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER AN HOUR'S IMMERSION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0044 IN THE REEKING ATMOSPHERE OF A LOW MUSIC HALL IN RATCLIFFE HIGHWAY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0045 WHERE I SAT NEXT A PORTLY FEMALE WHO SUFFERED FROM THE HEAT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0046 AND AT FREQUENT INTERVALS REFRESHED HERSELF AND AN INFANT FROM A BOTTLE OF TEPID STOUT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0047 BY THE FIRST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER I HAD ABANDONED ALL PALLIATIVES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0048 AND HAD SETTLED INTO THE DISMAL BUT DIGNIFIED ROUTINE OF OFFICE CLUB AND CHAMBERS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0049 AND NOW CAME THE MOST CRUEL TRIAL FOR THE HIDEOUS TRUTH DAWNED ON ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0050 THAT THE WORLD I FOUND SO INDISPENSABLE COULD AFTER ALL DISPENSE WITH ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0051 IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR LADY ASHLEIGH TO ASSURE ME THAT I WAS DEEPLY MISSED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0052 BUT A LETTER FROM F WHO WAS ONE OF THE PARTY WRITTEN IN HASTE JUST STARTING TO SHOOT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0053 AND COMING AS A TARDY REPLY TO ONE OF MY CLEVEREST
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0054 MADE ME AWARE THAT THE HOUSE PARTY HAD SUFFERED LITTLE FROM MY ABSENCE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0055 AND THAT FEW SIGHS WERE WASTED ON ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0056 EVEN IN THE QUARTER WHICH I HAD ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN DISCREETLY ALLUDED TO
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0057 BY THE UNDERLINED ALL IN LADY ASHLEIGH'S WE SHALL ALL MISS YOU A THRUST WHICH SMARTED MORE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0058 IF IT BIT LESS DEEPLY CAME FROM MY COUSIN NESTA WHO WROTE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0059 IT'S HORRID FOR YOU TO HAVE TO BE BAKING IN LONDON NOW BUT AFTER ALL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0060 IT MUST BE A GREAT PLEASURE TO YOU MALICIOUS LITTLE WRETCH TO
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0061 HAVE SUCH INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT WORK TO DO HERE WAS A NEMESIS FOR AN INNOCENT ILLUSION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0062 I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO FOSTER IN THE MINDS OF MY RELATIONS AND ACQUAINTANCES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0063 ESPECIALLY IN THE BREASTS OF THE TRUSTFUL AND ADMIRING MAIDENS WHOM I HAD TAKEN DOWN TO DINNER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0064 IN THE LAST TWO SEASONS A FICTION WHICH I HAD ALMOST REACHED THE POINT OF BELIEVING IN MYSELF
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0065 FOR THE PLAIN TRUTH WAS THAT MY WORK WAS NEITHER INTERESTING NOR IMPORTANT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0066 AND CONSISTED CHIEFLY AT PRESENT IN SMOKING CIGARETTES IN SAYING THAT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0067 MR SO AND SO WAS AWAY AND WOULD BE BACK ABOUT ONE ST OCTOBER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0068 IN BEING ABSENT FOR LUNCH FROM TWELVE TILL TWO AND IN MY SPARE MOMENTS MAKING PRECIS OF
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0069 LET US SAY THE LESS CONFIDENTIAL CONSULAR REPORTS AND SQUEEZING THE RESULTS INTO CAST IRON SCHEDULES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0070 THE REASON OF MY DETENTION WAS NOT A CLOUD ON THE INTERNATIONAL HORIZON
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0071 THOUGH I MAY SAY IN PASSING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A CLOUD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0072 BUT A CAPRICE ON THE PART OF A REMOTE AND MIGHTY PERSONAGE THE EFFECT OF WHICH
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0073 RAMIFYING DOWNWARDS HAD DISLOCATED THE CAREFULLY LAID HOLIDAY PLANS OF THE HUMBLE JUNIORS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0074 AND IN MY OWN SMALL CASE HAD UPSET THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MYSELF AND K
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0075 WHO POSITIVELY LIKED THE DOG DAYS IN WHITEHALL ONLY ONE THING WAS NEEDED TO FILL MY CUP OF BITTERNESS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0076 AND THIS IT WAS THAT SPECIALLY OCCUPIED ME AS I DRESSED FOR DINNER THIS EVENING
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0077 TWO DAYS MORE IN THIS DEAD AND FERMENTING CITY AND MY SLAVERY WOULD BE AT AN END
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0078 YES BUT IRONY OF IRONIES I HAD NOWHERE TO GO TO THE MORVEN LODGE PARTY WAS BREAKING UP
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0079 A DREADFUL RUMOUR AS TO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF ITS ACCURSED FRUITS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0080 TORMENTED ME WITH THE FRESH CERTAINTY THAT I HAD NOT BEEN MISSED AND BRED IN ME
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0081 THAT MOST DESOLATING BRAND OF CYNICISM WHICH IS PRODUCED BY DEFEAT THROUGH INSIGNIFICANCE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0082 INVITATIONS FOR A LATER DATE WHICH I HAD DECLINED IN JULY WITH A GRATIFYING SENSE OF BEING MUCH IN REQUEST
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0083 NOW ROSE UP SPECTRALLY TO TAUNT ME THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE WHICH I COULD EASILY HAVE REVIVED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0084 BUT NEITHER IN THIS CASE NOR IN ANY OTHER HAD THERE BEEN ANY RENEWAL OF PRESSURE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0085 AND THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROPOSING ONESELF AND SURRENDERING AS A PRIZE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0086 TO ONE OF SEVERAL EAGERLY COMPETING HOSTESSES SEEMS TOO CRUSHING TO BE CONTEMPLATED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0087 MY OWN PEOPLE WERE AT EZZ FOR MY FATHER'S GOUT TO JOIN THEM WAS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0088 A PIS ALLER WHOSE BANALITY WAS REPELLENT BESIDES THEY WOULD BE LEAVING SOON FOR OUR HOME IN YORKSHIRE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0089 AND I WAS NOT A PROPHET IN MY OWN COUNTRY IN SHORT

gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0091 PREPARED ME FOR THE KNOCK AND ENTRY OF WITHERS ONE OF THE THINGS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0092 WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME CEASED TO AMUSE ME WAS THE LAXITY OF MANNERS PROPER TO THE SEASON
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0093 AMONG THE SERVANTS OF THE BIG BLOCK OF CHAMBERS WHERE I LIVED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0094 WITHERS DEMURELY HANDED ME A LETTER BEARING A GERMAN POST MARK AND MARKED URGENT I
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0095 HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING AND WAS COLLECTING MY MONEY AND GLOVES A MOMENTARY THRILL OF CURIOSITY

gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0124 INTO MY POCKET AND STARTED LANGUIDLY ON THE VOIE DOULOUREUSE WHICH I NIGHTLY FOLLOWED TO THE CLUB
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0125 IN PALL MALL THERE WERE NO DIGNIFIED GREETINGS TO BE EXCHANGED NOW WITH WELL GROOMED ACQUAINTANCES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0126 THE ONLY PEOPLE TO BE SEEN WERE SOME LATE STRAGGLERS FROM THE PARK
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0127 WITH A PERAMBULATOR AND SOME HOT AND DUSTY CHILDREN LAGGING FRETFULLY BEHIND
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0128 SOME RUSTIC SIGHTSEERS DRAINING THE LAST DREGS OF THE DAYLIGHT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0129 IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE OUT FROM THEIR GUIDE BOOKS WHICH OF THESE REVEREND PILES WAS WHICH
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0130 A POLICEMAN AND A BUILDER'S CART OF COURSE THE CLUB WAS A STRANGE ONE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0131 BOTH OF MY OWN BEING CLOSED FOR CLEANING A COINCIDENCE EXPRESSLY PLANNED BY PROVIDENCE FOR MY INCONVENIENCE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0132 THE CLUB WHICH YOU ARE PERMITTED TO MAKE USE OF ON THESE OCCASIONS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0133 ALWAYS IRRITATES WITH ITS STRANGENESS AND DISCOMFORT THE FEW OCCUPANTS SEEM ODD AND ODDLY DRESSED

gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0135 THE DINNER IS EXECRABLE AND THE VENTILATION A FARCE ALL THESE EVILS OPPRESSED ME TO NIGHT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0136 AND YET I WAS PUZZLED TO FIND THAT SOMEWHERE WITHIN ME THERE WAS A FAINT LIGHTENING OF THE SPIRITS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0137 CAUSELESS AS FAR AS I COULD DISCOVER IT COULD NOT BE DAVIES'S LETTER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0138 YACHTING IN THE BALTIC AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER THE VERY IDEA MADE ONE SHUDDER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0139 COWES WITH A PLEASANT PARTY AND HOTELS HANDY WAS ALL VERY WELL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0140 AN AUGUST CRUISE ON A STEAM YACHT IN FRENCH WATERS OR THE HIGHLANDS WAS ALL VERY WELL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0141 BUT WHAT KIND OF A YACHT WAS THIS IT MUST BE OF A CERTAIN SIZE TO HAVE GOT SO FAR
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0142 BUT I THOUGHT I REMEMBERED ENOUGH OF DAVIES'S MEANS TO KNOW THAT HE HAD NO MONEY TO WASTE ON LUXURIES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0143 THAT BROUGHT ME TO THE MAN HIMSELF I HAD KNOWN HIM AT OXFORD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0144 NOT AS ONE OF MY IMMEDIATE SET BUT WE WERE A SOCIABLE COLLEGE AND I HAD SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIM
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0145 LIKING HIM FOR HIS PHYSICAL ENERGY COMBINED WITH A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY AND MODESTY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0146 THOUGH INDEED HE HAD NOTHING TO BE CONCEITED ABOUT LIKED HIM IN FACT IN THE WAY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0147 THAT AT THAT RECEPTIVE PERIOD ONE LIKES MANY MEN WHOM ONE NEVER KEEPS UP WITH LATER
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0148 WE HAD BOTH GONE DOWN IN THE SAME YEAR THREE YEARS AGO NOW
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0149 I HAD GONE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY FOR TWO YEARS TO LEARN THE LANGUAGES
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0150 HE HAD FAILED FOR THE INDIAN CIVIL AND THEN HAD GONE INTO A SOLICITOR'S OFFICE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0151 I HAD ONLY SEEN HIM SINCE AT RARE INTERVALS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0152 THOUGH I ADMITTED TO MYSELF THAT FOR HIS PART HE HAD CLUNG LOYALLY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0153 TO WHAT TIES OF FRIENDSHIP THERE WERE BETWEEN US
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0154 BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT WE HAD DRIFTED APART FROM THE NATURE OF THINGS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0155 I HAD PASSED BRILLIANTLY INTO MY PROFESSION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0156 AND ON THE FEW OCCASIONS I HAD MET HIM SINCE I MADE MY TRIUMPHANT DEBUT IN SOCIETY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0157 I HAD FOUND NOTHING LEFT IN COMMON BETWEEN US HE SEEMED TO KNOW NONE OF MY FRIENDS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0158 HE DRESSED INDIFFERENTLY AND I THOUGHT HIM DULL I HAD ALWAYS CONNECTED HIM WITH BOATS AND THE SEA
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0159 BUT NEVER WITH YACHTING IN THE SENSE THAT I UNDERSTOOD IT IN COLLEGE DAYS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0160 HE HAD NEARLY PERSUADED ME INTO SHARING A SQUALID WEEK IN SOME OPEN BOAT HE HAD PICKED UP
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0161 AND WAS GOING TO SAIL AMONG SOME DREARY MUD FLATS SOMEWHERE ON THE EAST COAST
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0162 THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE AND THE FUNEREAL FUNCTION OF DINNER DRIFTED ON
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0163 BUT I FOUND MYSELF REMEMBERING AT THE ENTREE THAT I HAD RECENTLY HEARD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0164 AT SECOND OR THIRD HAND OF SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT HIM EXACTLY WHAT I COULD NOT RECALL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0165 WHEN I REACHED THE SAVOURY I HAD CONCLUDED SO FAR AS I HAD CENTRED MY MIND ON IT AT ALL
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0166 THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS A CULMINATING IRONY AS INDEED WAS THE SAVOURY IN ITS WAY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0167 AFTER THE WRECK OF MY PLEASANT PLANS AND THE FIASCO OF MY MARTYRDOM
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0168 TO BE ASKED AS CONSOLATION TO SPEND OCTOBER FREEZING IN THE BALTIC WITH AN ECCENTRIC NONENTITY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0169 WHO BORED ME YET AS I SMOKED MY CIGAR IN THE GHASTLY SPLENDOUR OF THE EMPTY SMOKING ROOM
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0170 THE SUBJECT CAME UP AGAIN WAS THERE ANYTHING IN IT THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO ALTERNATIVES AT HAND
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0171 AND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE BALTIC AT THIS UNEARTHLY TIME OF YEAR HAD
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0172 AT LEAST A SMACK OF TRAGIC THOROUGHNESS ABOUT IT I PULLED OUT THE LETTER AGAIN
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0173 AND RAN DOWN ITS IMPULSIVE STACCATO SENTENCES AFFECTING TO IGNORE WHAT A GUST OF FRESH AIR
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0174 HIGH SPIRITS AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP THIS FLIMSY BIT OF PAPER WAFTED INTO THE JADED CLUB ROOM
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0175 ON REPERUSAL IT WAS FULL OF EVIL PRESAGE AL SCENERY BUT WHAT OF EQUINOCTIAL STORMS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0176 AND OCTOBER FOGS EVERY SANE YACHTSMAN WAS PAYING OFF HIS CREW NOW THERE OUGHT TO BE DUCK
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0177 VAGUE VERY VAGUE IF IT GETS COLD ENOUGH COLD AND YACHTING SEEMED TO BE A GRATUITOUSLY MONSTROUS UNION
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0178 HIS PALS HAD LEFT HIM WHY NOT THE YACHTING BRAND AND WHY NOT
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0179 AS TO THE SIZE COMFORT AND CREW OF THE YACHT ALL CHEERFULLY IGNORED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0180 SO MANY MADDENING BLANKS AND BY THE WAY WHY IN HEAVEN'S NAME A PRISMATIC COMPASS
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0181 I FINGERED A FEW MAGAZINES PLAYED A GAME OF FIFTY WITH A FRIENDLY OLD FOGEY
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0182 TOO IMPORTUNATE TO BE WORTH THE LABOUR OF RESISTING AND WENT BACK TO MY CHAMBERS TO BED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0183 IGNORANT THAT A FRIENDLY PROVIDENCE HAD COME TO MY RESCUE AND INDEED
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0184 RATHER RESENTING ANY CLUMSY ATTEMPT AT SUCH FRIENDLINESS END OF CHAPTER ONE
gesine-20080421-rid/wav/rid0185 RECORDED BY GESINE IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
gilrim-20080120-ohc/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER

gilrim-20080120-rda/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
gilrim-20080120-rzu/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
gilrim-20080120-uxi/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
gilrim-20080120-uxi/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
gilrim-20080120-uxi/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
gilrim-20080120-uxi/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST

gilrim-20080120-vgs/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
gilrim-20080120-vgs/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
gilrim-20080120-vgs/wav/b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
gilrim-20080120-vgs/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
gilrim-20080120-vgs/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES

giovanni-20090708-xlb/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
giovanni-20090708-xlb/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
giovanni-20090708-xlb/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
giovanni-20090708-xlb/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED

glenn-20080119-dgu/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
glenn-20080119-dgu/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
glenn-20080119-dgu/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
glenn-20080119-dgu/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
glenn-20080119-dgu/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU

glenton-20090924-ggk/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
glenton-20090924-ggk/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
glenton-20090924-ggk/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
glenton-20090924-ggk/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
glenton-20090924-iaz/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
glenton-20090924-iij/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
glenton-20090924-lpy/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
glenton-20090924-mad/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
glenton-20090924-myq/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
glenton-20090924-nmb/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
glenton-20090924-ojx/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
glenton-20090924-oqo/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
glenton-20090924-plp/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
glenton-20090924-puv/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
glenton-20090924-qpb/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
glenton-20090924-ryq/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
glenton-20090924-sve/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
glenton-20090924-vzf/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
glenton-20090924-yia/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
glenton-20090924-ylv/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
glenton-20091002-npj/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0550 ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
gman108406-20091119-fuw/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
gman108406-20091119-nep/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
gman108406-20091119-uph/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
gman108406-20091119-zhi/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
GrahamPhillips-20071111-oxp/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
grav-20091226-qox/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
gravity-20080309-bmr/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
gravity-20080309-box/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
gravity-20080309-mms/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
gravity-20080309-vca/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
greekenglish-20091229-rcc/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
greekenglish-20091229-rfe/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
grnorton-20080516-gdp/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
grnorton-20080516-nlr/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
grnorton-20080516-nwa/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
grnorton-20080516-und/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
grnorton-20080516-vlg/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
grnorton-20080516-zfn/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
guilherme-20080123-pfh/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
Gweilo-20081014-jlz/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
h2oetry-20090510-nuj/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AND WELL
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0411 I WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCE
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
hadock-20080522-idu/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
halespawn-20090430-bft/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
halespawn-20090430-csk/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
halespawn-20090430-lzk/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK

halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
halespawn-20090430-ycu/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK

HessesiaN-20080605-ahm/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
HessesiaN-20080605-ahm/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
HessesiaN-20080605-ahm/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
HessesiaN-20080605-ahm/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET

hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0005 NISUS AND SCYLLA MINOS KING OF CRETE MADE WAR UPON MEGARA
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0006 NISUS WAS KING OF MEGARA AND SCYLLA WAS HIS DAUGHTER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0007 THE SIEGE HAD NOW LASTED SIX MONTHS AND THE CITY STILL HELD OUT FOR IT WAS DECREED BY FATE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0008 THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SO LONG AS A CERTAIN PURPLE LOCK
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0009 WHICH GLITTERED AMONG THE HAIR OF KING NISUS REMAINED ON HIS HEAD
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0010 THERE WAS A TOWER ON THE CITY WALLS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0011 WHICH OVERLOOKED THE PLAIN WHERE MINOS AND HIS ARMY WERE ENCAMPED
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0012 TO THIS TOWER SCYLLA USED TO REPAIR
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0013 AND LOOK ABROAD OVER THE TENTS OF THE HOSTILE ARMY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0014 THE SIEGE HAD LASTED SO LONG THAT SHE HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH THE PERSONS OF THE LEADERS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0015 MINOS IN PARTICULAR EXCITED HER ADMIRATION
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0016 ARRAYED IN HIS HELMET AND BEARING HIS SHIELD SHE ADMIRED HIS GRACEFUL DEPORTMENT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0017 IF HE THREW HIS JAVELIN SKILL SEEMED COMBINED WITH FORCE IN THE DISCHARGE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0018 IF HE DREW HIS BOW APOLLO HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT MORE GRACEFULLY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0019 BUT WHEN HE LAID ASIDE HIS HELMET AND IN HIS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0020 PURPLE ROBES BESTRODE HIS WHITE HORSE WITH ITS GAY CAPARISONS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0021 AND REINED IN ITS FOAMING MOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0022 THE DAUGHTER OF NISUS WAS HARDLY MISTRESS OF HERSELF
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0023 SHE WAS ALMOST FRANTIC WITH ADMIRATION SHE ENVIED THE WEAPON THAT HE GRASPED
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0024 THE REINS THAT HE HELD
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0025 SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD IF IT WERE POSSIBLE GO TO HIM THROUGH THE HOSTILE RANKS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0026 SHE FELT AN IMPULSE TO CAST HERSELF DOWN FROM THE TOWER INTO THE MIDST OF HIS CAMP
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0027 OR TO OPEN THE GATES TO HIM
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0028 OR TO DO ANYTHING ELSE SO ONLY IT MIGHT GRATIFY MINOS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0029 AS SHE SAT IN THE TOWER SHE TALKED THUS WITH HERSELF
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0030 I KNOW NOT WHETHER TO REJOICE OR GRIEVE AT THIS SAD WAR
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0031 I GRIEVE THAT MINOS IS OUR ENEMY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0032 BUT I REJOICE AT ANY CAUSE THAT BRINGS HIM TO MY SIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0033 PERHAPS HE WOULD BE WILLING TO GRANT US PEACE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0034 AND RECEIVE ME AS A HOSTAGE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0035 I WOULD FLY DOWN IF I COULD AND ALIGHT IN HIS CAMP AND TELL HIM THAT WE YIELD OURSELVES TO HIS MERCY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0036 BUT THEN TO BETRAY MY FATHER NO
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0037 RATHER WOULD I NEVER SEE MINOS AGAIN
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0038 AND YET NO DOUBT IT IS SOMETIMES THE BEST THING FOR A CITY TO BE CONQUERED
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0039 WHEN THE CONQUEROR IS CLEMENT AND GENEROUS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0040 MINOS CERTAINLY HAS RIGHT ON HIS SIDE I THINK WE SHALL BE CONQUERED
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0041 AND IF THAT MUST BE THE END OF IT WHY SHOULD NOT LOVE UNBAR THE GATES TO HIM INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0042 TO BE DONE BY WAR BETTER SPARE DELAY AND SLAUGHTER IF WE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0043 CAN AND O IF ANY ONE SHOULD WOUND OR KILL MINOS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0044 NO ONE SURELY WOULD HAVE THE HEART TO DO IT YET
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0045 IGNORANTLY NOT KNOWING HIM ONE MIGHT I WILL I WILL SURRENDER MYSELF TO HIM
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0046 WITH MY COUNTRY AS A DOWRY AND SO PUT AN END TO THE WAR
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0047 BUT HOW THE GATES ARE GUARDED AND MY FATHER KEEPS THE KEYS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0048 HE ONLY STANDS IN MY WAY O THAT IT MIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0049 PLEASE THE GODS TO TAKE HIM AWAY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0050 BUT WHY ASK THE GODS TO DO IT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0051 ANOTHER WOMAN LOVING AS I DO WOULD
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0052 REMOVE WITH HER OWN HANDS WHATEVER STOOD IN THE WAY OF HER LOVE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0053 AND CAN ANY OTHER WOMAN DARE MORE THAN I
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0054 I WOULD ENCOUNTER FIRE AND SWORD TO GAIN MY OBJECT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0055 BUT HERE THERE IS NO NEED OF FIRE AND SWORD I
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0056 ONLY NEED MY FATHER'S PURPLE LOCK MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD TO ME
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0057 THAT WILL GIVE ME ALL I WISH
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0058 WHILE SHE THUS REASONED NIGHT CAME ON
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0059 AND SOON THE WHOLE PALACE WAS BURIED IN SLEEP
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0060 SHE ENTERED HER FATHER'S BEDCHAMBER AND CUT OFF THE FATAL LOCK
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0061 THEN PASSED OUT OF THE CITY AND ENTERED THE ENEMY'S CAMP
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0062 SHE DEMANDED TO BE LED TO THE KING AND THUS ADDRESSED HIM
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0063 I AM SCYLLA THE DAUGHTER OF NISUS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0064 I SURRENDER TO YOU MY COUNTRY AND MY FATHER'S HOUSE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0065 I ASK NO REWARD BUT YOURSELF FOR LOVE OF YOU I HAVE DONE IT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0066 SEE HERE THE PURPLE LOCK WITH THIS I GIVE YOU MY FATHER AND HIS KINGDOM
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0067 SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WITH THE FATAL SPOIL
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0068 MINOS SHRUNK BACK AND REFUSED TO TOUCH IT THE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0069 GODS DESTROY THEE INFAMOUS WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED DISGRACE OF OUR TIME
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0070 MAY NEITHER EARTH NOR SEA YIELD THEE A RESTING PLACE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0071 SURELY MY CRETE WHERE JOVE HIMSELF WAS CRADLED SHALL NOT BE POLLUTED WITH SUCH A MONSTER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0072 THUS HE SAID AND GAVE ORDERS THAT EQUITABLE TERMS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO THE CONQUERED CITY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0073 AND THAT THE FLEET SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SAIL FROM THE ISLAND
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0074 SCYLLA WAS FRANTIC UNGRATEFUL MAN SHE EXCLAIMED IS IT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0075 THUS YOU LEAVE ME ME WHO HAVE GIVEN YOU VICTORY

hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0078 BUT NOT BY YOUR HAND AS THE SHIPS LEFT THE SHORE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0079 SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER AND SEIZING THE RUDDER OF THE ONE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0080 WHICH CARRIED MINOS SHE WAS BORNE ALONG AN UNWELCOME COMPANION OF THEIR COURSE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0081 A SEA EAGLE ING ALOFT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0082 IT WAS HER FATHER WHO HAD BEEN CHANGED INTO THAT FORM
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0083 SEEING HER POUNCED DOWN UPON HER AND STRUCK HER WITH HIS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0084 BEAK AND CLAWS IN TERROR SHE LET GO THE SHIP
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0085 AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER BUT SOME PITYING DEITY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0086 CHANGED HER INTO A BIRD THE SEA EAGLE STILL CHERISHES THE OLD ANIMOSITY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0087 AND WHENEVER HE ESPIES HER IN HIS LOFTY FLIGHT YOU MAY SEE HIM DART DOWN UPON HER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0088 WITH BEAK AND CLAWS TO TAKE VENGEANCE FOR THE ANCIENT CRIME
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0089 ECHO AND NARCISSUS ECHO WAS A BEAUTIFUL NYMPH FOND OF THE WOODS AND HILLS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0090 WHERE SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TO WOODLAND SPORTS SHE WAS A FAVORITE OF DIANA
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0091 AND ATTENDED HER IN THE CHASE BUT ECHO HAD ONE FAILING
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0092 SHE WAS FOND OF TALKING AND WHETHER IN CHAT OR ARGUMENT WOULD
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0093 HAVE THE LAST WORD ONE DAY JUNO WAS SEEKING HER HUSBAND WHO
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0094 SHE HAD REASON TO FEAR WAS AMUSING HIMSELF AMONG THE NYMPHS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0095 ECHO BY HER TALK CONTRIVED TO DETAIN THE GODDESS TILL THE NYMPHS MADE THEIR ESCAPE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0096 WHEN JUNO DISCOVERED IT SHE PASSED SENTENCE UPON ECHO IN THESE WORDS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0097 YOU SHALL FORFEIT THE USE OF THAT TONGUE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0098 WITH WHICH YOU HAVE CHEATED ME EXCEPT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0099 FOR THAT ONE PURPOSE YOU ARE SO FOND OF REPLY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0100 YOU SHALL STILL HAVE THE LAST WORD BUT NO POWER TO SPEAK FIRST
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0101 THIS NYMPH SAW NARCISSUS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0102 AS HE PURSUED THE CHASE UPON THE MOUNTAINS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0103 SHE LOVED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIS FOOTSTEPS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0104 O HOW SHE LONGED TO ADDRESS HIM IN THE SOFTEST ACCENTS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0105 AND WIN HIM TO CONVERSE BUT IT WAS NOT IN HER POWER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0106 SHE WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE FOR HIM TO SPEAK FIRST
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0107 AND HAD HER ANSWER READY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0108 ONE DAY THE YOUTH BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS COMPANIONS SHOUTED ALOUD WHO'S HERE

hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0112 LET US JOIN ONE ANOTHER SAID THE YOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0113 THE MAID ANSWERED WITH ALL HER HEART IN THE SAME WORDS AND HASTENED TO THE SPOT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0114 READY TO THROW HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK HE STARTED BACK EXCLAIMING
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0115 HANDS OFF I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE ME
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0116 HAVE ME SAID SHE BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0117 HE LEFT HER AND SHE WENT TO HIDE HER BLUSHES
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0118 IN THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0119 FROM THAT TIME FORTH SHE LIVED IN CAVES AND AMONG MOUNTAIN CLIFFS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0120 HER FORM FADED WITH GRIEF TILL AT LAST ALL HER FLESH SHRANK AWAY
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0121 HER BONES WERE CHANGED INTO ROCKS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0122 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF HER BUT HER VOICE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0123 WITH THAT SHE IS STILL READY TO REPLY TO ANY ONE WHO CALLS HER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0124 AND KEEPS UP HER OLD HABIT OF HAVING THE LAST WORD
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0125 NARCISSUS'S CRUELTY IN THIS CASE WAS NOT THE ONLY INSTANCE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0126 HE SHUNNED ALL THE REST OF THE NYMPHS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0127 AS HE HAD DONE POOR ECHO
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0128 ONE DAY A MAIDEN WHO HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO ATTRACT HIM UTTERED A PRAYER THAT HE MIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0129 SOME TIME OR OTHER FEEL WHAT IT WAS TO LOVE AND MEET NO RETURN OF AFFECTION
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0130 THE AVENGING GODDESS HEARD AND GRANTED THE PRAYER THERE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0131 WAS A CLEAR FOUNTAIN WITH WATER LIKE SILVER TO WHICH THE SHEPHERDS NEVER DROVE THEIR FLOCKS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0132 NOR THE MOUNTAIN GOATS RESORTED NOR ANY OF THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0133 NEITHER WAS IT DEFACED WITH FALLEN LEAVES OR BRANCHES
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0134 BUT THE GRASS GREW FRESH AROUND IT AND THE ROCKS SHELTERED IT FROM THE SUN
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0135 HITHER CAME ONE DAY THE YOUTH FATIGUED WITH HUNTING
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0136 HEATED AND THIRSTY HE STOOPED DOWN TO DRINK
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0137 AND SAW HIS OWN IMAGE IN THE WATER
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0138 HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOME BEAUTIFUL WATER SPIRIT LIVING IN THE FOUNTAIN
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0139 HE STOOD GAZING WITH ADMIRATION AT THOSE
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0140 BRIGHT EYES THOSE LOCKS CURLED LIKE THE LOCKS OF BACCHUS OR APOLLO
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0141 THE ROUNDED CHEEKS THE IVORY NECK THE PARTED LIPS
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0142 AND THE GLOW OF HEALTH AND EXERCISE OVER ALL
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0143 HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF
hugh-20070606-bul/wav/bul0144 HE BROUGHT HIS LIPS NEAR TO TAKE A KISS
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE

Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER

Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
Hyshinara-20080326-uul/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY

Hyshinara-20080326-vfv/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
Hyshinara-20080326-vfv/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
Hyshinara-20080326-vfv/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL

Hyshinara-20080326-vfv/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY

Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
Hyshinara-20080326-zbx/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
ikxhitiz-20091208-zzt/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
indy-20081103-pot/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
indymaynard-20090723-rig/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
inequation-20090916-ale/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
inequation-20090916-rsf/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
inequation-20090916-tff/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
ivan-20090303-tjm/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
jade-20100109-bvy/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
jade-20100109-eqe/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
jade-20100109-gxb/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
jade-20100109-how/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
jade-20100109-qdo/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
jade-20100109-vpg/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
jakupl-20090530-qos/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
JamesHays-20090703-gok/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
jamincollins-20081108-izf/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
jamincollins-20081108-slm/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
jazzman-20080709-zjw/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
jchitt-20080625-cc/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

jeremybub-20081021-cwp/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
jeremybub-20081021-xbn/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
jippen-20090218-his/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
jlrice9673-20090622-nop/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
jlrice9673-20090623-agu/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
jlrice9673-20090625-len/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
jo-20090106-bbq/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
Joel-20080716-qoz/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0378 BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
joel-20091112-aaq/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME
joel-20091112-cdp/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
joel-20091112-hmo/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
joel-20091112-vwo/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0315 THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
joel-20091116-aqq/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
joel-20091116-ehr/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
joel-20091116-gpo/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
joel-20091116-hih/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
joel-20091116-hih/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
joel-20091116-hih/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-26 POSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-30 COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
joel-20091116-hih/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED IN
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
joel-20091116-onv/wav/b0501 WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
joel-20091116-uin/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS

joel-20091206-dem/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
joel4039-20091223-oqi/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH

JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
JohanLingen-20080302-hwq/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
JohanLingen-20080302-vvd/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
JohanLingen-20080304-fld/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
JohanLingen-20080304-fse/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
JohanLingen-20080304-lpt/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
JohanLingen-20080304-myv/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
JohanLingen-20080304-wfq/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
JohanLingen-20080306-dbl/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
JohanLingen-20080306-nov/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
JohanLingen-20080306-utt/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
JohanLingen-20080306-xvq/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
JohanLingen-20080306-zqm/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
john-20081011-jnr/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
John-20090617-loy/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
John-20090617-ntl/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
John-20090617-uqc/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0041 DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
jooles-20080826/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR

jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER

jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
jpbailey-20090201-lqs/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
JRB-20080602-keb/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
JRB-20080602-qyg/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
jtmiles-20090618-iug/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
jtmiles-20090618-llp/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
jtmiles-20090618-psn/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
jtmiles-20090618-ton/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
jtmiles-20090618-tso/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
jtmiles-20090618-uad/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
jtmiles-20090618-zga/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
juan-20091128-uih/wav/a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
k-20090202-afe/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
k-20090202-bzc/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
k-20090202-csh/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
k-20090202-ddq/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
k-20090202-dfj/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
k-20090202-dkx/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
k-20090202-dty/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
k-20090202-fgs/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
k-20090202-fyr/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
k-20090202-fyr/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
k-20090202-fyr/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
k-20090202-fyr/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
k-20090202-hrd/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE

k-20090202-jux/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
k-20090202-jux/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
k-20090202-jux/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
k-20090202-jux/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT

k-20090202-kqq/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
k-20090202-kqq/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
k-20090202-kqq/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL

k-20090204-tja/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
k-20090204-tja/wav/b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
k-20090204-tyq/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
k-20090204-yav/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
k-20090204-ymt/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
kaeles-20090413-jva/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
kaeles-20090413-mtv/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-sdw/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
KaloyanKolev-20080907-wpo/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
KaloyanKolev-20080907-xuc/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
Karageorgos-20090722-lst/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES

kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0004 THIS READING BY KARA SHALLENBERG PERSUASION BY JANE AUSTEN CHAPTER FOUR
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0005 HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0006 HOWEVER SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH HIS BROTHER WHO
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0007 BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION OFF ST DOMINGO
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0008 AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN OH SIX
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0009 AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING FOUND A HOME FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0010 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0011 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE SPIRIT AND BRILLIANCY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0012 AND ANNE AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL WITH GENTLENESS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0013 MODESTY TASTE AND FEELING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0014 HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION ON EITHER SIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0015 FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO DO AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0016 BUT THE ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0017 THEY WERE GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED AND WHEN ACQUAINTED RAPIDLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0018 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE OTHER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0019 OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST SHE IN RECEIVING HIS DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0020 OR HE IN HAVING THEM ACCEPTED A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0021 AND BUT A SHORT ONE TROUBLES SOON AROSE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0022 SIR WALTER ON BEING APPLIED TO WITHOUT ACTUALLY WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0023 OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE GAVE IT ALL THE NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0024 GREAT COLDNESS GREAT SILENCE AND A PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0025 HE THOUGHT IT A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE AND LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0026 THOUGH WITH MORE TEMPERED AND PARDONABLE PRIDE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0027 RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0028 WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH BEAUTY AND MIND
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0029 TO THROW HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0030 INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH A YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0031 WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF TO RECOMMEND HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0032 AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0033 BUT IN THE CHANCES OF A MOST UNCERTAIN PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0034 AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0035 WOULD BE INDEED A THROWING AWAY WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO THINK OF
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0036 ANNE ELLIOT SO YOUNG
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0037 KNOWN TO SO FEW TO BE SNATCHED OFF BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0038 OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A STATE OF MOST WEARING ANXIOUS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0039 YOUTH KILLING DEPENDENCE IT MUST NOT BE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0040 IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE OF FRIENDSHIP
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0041 ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0042 AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS IT WOULD BE PREVENTED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0043 HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0044 BUT SPENDING FREELY WHAT HAD COME FREELY HAD REALIZED NOTHING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0045 BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0046 FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0047 AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0048 HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY HE KNEW HE SHOULD BE SO STILL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0049 SUCH CONFIDENCE POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH AND BEWITCHING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0050 IN THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0051 MUST HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR ANNE BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0052 HIS SANGUINE TEMPER AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON HER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0053 SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0054 IT ONLY ADDED A DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF HE WAS BRILLIANT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0055 HE WAS HEADSTRONG LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0056 AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0057 SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0058 SUCH OPPOSITION AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED WAS MORE THAN ANNE COULD COMBAT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0059 YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0060 IT MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL WILL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0061 THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0062 BUT LADY RUSSELL WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON COULD NOT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0063 WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0064 BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0065 SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0066 INDISCREET IMPROPER HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUCCESS AND NOT DESERVING IT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0067 BUT IT WAS NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED IN PUTTING AN END TO IT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0068 HAD SHE NOT IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0069 EVEN MORE THAN HER OWN SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0070 THE BELIEF OF BEING PRUDENT AND SELF DENYING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0071 PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE WAS HER CHIEF CONSOLATION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0072 UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING A FINAL PARTING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0073 AND EVERY CONSOLATION WAS REQUIRED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0074 FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL PAIN OF OPINIONS ON HIS SIDE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0075 TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING AND OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF ILL USED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0076 BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT HE HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0077 A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0078 BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0079 HER ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD FOR A LONG TIME
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0080 CLOUDED EVERY ENJOYMENT OF YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0081 AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING EFFECT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0082 MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0083 AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0084 BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0085 NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN IN CHANGE OF PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0086 EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0087 OR IN ANY NOVELTY OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0088 NO ONE HAD EVER COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH CIRCLE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0089 WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH FREDERICK WENTWORTH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0090 AS HE STOOD IN HER MEMORY NO SECOND ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0091 THE ONLY THOROUGHLY NATURAL HAPPY AND SUFFICIENT CURE AT HER TIME OF LIFE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0092 HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0093 THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0094 SHE HAD BEEN SOLICITED WHEN ABOUT TWO AND TWENTY TO CHANGE HER NAME BY THE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0095 WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0096 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0097 FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0098 AND GENERAL IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0099 AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0100 AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0101 WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0102 SHE WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY TWO SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0103 FROM THE PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0104 AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF BUT IN THIS CASE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0105 ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR ADVICE TO DO AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0106 AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER OWN DISCRETION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0107 NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0108 SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE ANXIETY WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0109 BY SOME MAN OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0110 TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD HER TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0111 BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0112 EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0113 FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BUT ANNE AT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0114 SEVEN AND TWENTY THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0115 SHE DID NOT BLAME LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0116 SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0117 BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0118 TO APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0119 THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH CERTAIN IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0120 SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0121 UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0122 AND EVERY ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0123 SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN IN MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0124 THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT AND THIS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0125 SHE FULLY BELIEVED HAD THE USUAL SHARE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0126 HAD EVEN MORE THAN THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0127 WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE WHICH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0128 AS IT HAPPENED WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN COULD BE REASONABLY CALCULATED ON
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0129 ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS ALL HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0130 HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR HAD SEEMED TO FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0131 HE HAD VERY SOON AFTER THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED GOT EMPLOY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0132 AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD FOLLOW HAD TAKEN PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0133 HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND EARLY GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0134 AND MUST NOW BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0135 SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR HER AUTHORITY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0136 BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0137 AND IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0138 SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0139 HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN HOW ELOQUENT AT LEAST
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0140 WERE HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0141 AND A CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0142 AGAINST THAT OVER ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH SEEMS TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0143 SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0144 SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0145 THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0146 WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0147 SHE COULD NOT HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0148 WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0149 AND MANY A STROLL AND MANY A SIGH WERE NECESSARY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0150 TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0151 SHE OFTEN TOLD HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0152 BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES SUFFICIENTLY TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0153 AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL SHE WAS ASSISTED HOWEVER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0154 BY THAT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0155 AMONG THE ONLY THREE OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN THE SECRET OF THE PAST
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0156 WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY ANY RECOLLECTION OF IT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0157 SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES IN THIS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0158 OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0159 SHE COULD HONOUR ALL THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0160 BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0161 FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG AND IN THE EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY TAKING KELLYNCH HALL
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0162 SHE REJOICED ANEW OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0163 OF THE PAST BEING KNOWN TO THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0164 BY WHOM NO SYLLABLE SHE BELIEVED WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0165 AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0166 THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT LIVED ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0167 THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0168 AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN AND MOREOVER A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0169 SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO HUMAN CREATURE'S HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0170 THE SISTER MRS CROFT
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0171 HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND ACCOMPANYING HER HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0172 AND HER OWN SISTER MARY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0173 AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0174 AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0175 WITH THESE SUPPORTS SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0176 WHICH WITH LADY RUSSELL STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF
kayray-20070425-per04/wav/per0177 MUST BE ANTICIPATED NEED NOT INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS

kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0005 A VERY FEW DAYS MORE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS KNOWN TO BE AT KELLYNCH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0006 AND MR MUSGROVE HAD CALLED ON HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0007 AND COME BACK WARM IN HIS PRAISE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0008 AND HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE CROFTS TO DINE AT UPPERCROSS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0009 IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR MUSGROVE TO FIND THAT NO EARLIER DAY COULD BE FIXED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0010 SO IMPATIENT WAS HE TO SHEW HIS GRATITUDE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0011 BY SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH UNDER HIS OWN ROOF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0012 AND WELCOMING HIM TO ALL THAT WAS STRONGEST AND BEST IN HIS CELLARS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0013 BUT A WEEK MUST PASS ONLY A WEEK IN ANNE'S RECKONING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0014 AND THEN SHE SUPPOSED THEY MUST MEET
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0015 AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE COULD FEEL SECURE EVEN FOR A WEEK
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0016 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MADE A VERY EARLY RETURN TO MR MUSGROVE'S CIVILITY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0017 AND SHE WAS ALL BUT CALLING THERE IN THE SAME HALF HOUR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0018 SHE AND MARY WERE ACTUALLY SETTING FORWARD FOR THE GREAT HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0019 WHERE AS SHE AFTERWARDS LEARNT THEY MUST INEVITABLY HAVE FOUND HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0020 WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE ELDEST BOY'S BEING AT THAT MOMENT BROUGHT HOME IN CONSEQUENCE OF A BAD FALL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0021 THE CHILD'S SITUATION PUT THE VISIT ENTIRELY ASIDE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0022 BUT SHE COULD NOT HEAR OF HER ESCAPE WITH INDIFFERENCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0023 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE SERIOUS ANXIETY WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FELT ON HIS ACCOUNT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0024 HIS COLLAR BONE WAS FOUND TO BE DISLOCATED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0025 AND SUCH INJURY RECEIVED IN THE BACK AS ROUSED THE MOST ALARMING IDEAS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0026 IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF DISTRESS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0027 AND ANNE HAD EVERY THING TO DO AT ONCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0028 THE APOTHECARY TO SEND FOR THE FATHER TO HAVE PURSUED AND INFORMED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0029 THE MOTHER TO SUPPORT AND KEEP FROM HYSTERICS THE SERVANTS TO CONTROL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0030 THE YOUNGEST CHILD TO BANISH AND THE POOR SUFFERING ONE TO ATTEND AND SOOTHE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0031 BESIDES SENDING AS SOON AS SHE RECOLLECTED IT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0032 PROPER NOTICE TO THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0033 WHICH BROUGHT HER AN ACCESSION RATHER OF FRIGHTENED ENQUIRING COMPANIONS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0034 THAN OF VERY USEFUL ASSISTANTS HER BROTHER'S RETURN WAS THE FIRST COMFORT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0035 HE COULD TAKE BEST CARE OF HIS WIFE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0036 AND THE SECOND BLESSING WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0037 TILL HE CAME AND HAD EXAMINED THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0038 THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE THE WORSE FOR BEING VAGUE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0039 THEY SUSPECTED GREAT INJURY BUT KNEW NOT WHERE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0040 BUT NOW THE COLLAR BONE WAS SOON REPLACED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0041 AND THOUGH MR ROBINSON FELT AND FELT AND RUBBED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0042 AND LOOKED GRAVE AND SPOKE LOW WORDS BOTH TO THE FATHER AND THE AUNT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0043 STILL THEY WERE ALL TO HOPE THE BEST
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0044 AND TO BE ABLE TO PART AND EAT THEIR DINNER IN TOLERABLE EASE OF MIND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0045 AND THEN IT WAS JUST BEFORE THEY PARTED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0046 THAT THE TWO YOUNG AUNTS WERE ABLE SO FAR TO DIGRESS FROM THEIR NEPHEW'S STATE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0047 AS TO GIVE THE INFORMATION OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VISIT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0048 STAYING FIVE MINUTES BEHIND THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0049 TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPRESS HOW PERFECTLY DELIGHTED THEY WERE WITH HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0050 HOW MUCH HANDSOMER HOW INFINITELY MORE AGREEABLE THEY THOUGHT HIM THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL AMONG THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0051 WHO HAD BEEN AT ALL A FAVOURITE BEFORE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0052 HOW GLAD THEY HAD BEEN TO HEAR PAPA INVITE HIM TO STAY DINNER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0053 HOW SORRY WHEN HE SAID IT WAS QUITE OUT OF HIS POWER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0054 AND HOW GLAD AGAIN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0055 IN REPLY TO PAPA AND MAMMA'S FARTHER PRESSING INVITATIONS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0056 TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM ON THE MORROW
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0057 ACTUALLY ON THE MORROW AND HE HAD PROMISED IT IN SO PLEASANT A MANNER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0058 AS IF HE FELT ALL THE MOTIVE OF THEIR ATTENTION JUST AS HE OUGHT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0059 AND IN SHORT HE HAD LOOKED AND SAID EVERYTHING WITH SUCH EXQUISITE GRACE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0060 THAT THEY COULD ASSURE THEM ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BOTH TURNED BY HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0061 AND OFF THEY RAN QUITE AS FULL OF GLEE AS OF LOVE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0062 AND APPARENTLY MORE FULL OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN OF LITTLE CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0063 THE SAME STORY AND THE SAME RAPTURES WERE REPEATED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0064 WHEN THE TWO GIRLS CAME WITH THEIR FATHER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0065 THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE EVENING TO MAKE ENQUIRIES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0066 AND MR MUSGROVE NO LONGER UNDER THE FIRST UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS HEIR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0067 COULD ADD HIS CONFIRMATION AND PRAISE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0068 AND HOPE THERE WOULD BE NOW NO OCCASION FOR PUTTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OFF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0069 AND ONLY BE SORRY TO THINK THAT THE COTTAGE PARTY PROBABLY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0070 WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE THE LITTLE BOY TO GIVE HIM THE MEETING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0071 OH NO AS TO LEAVING THE LITTLE BOY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0072 BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN MUCH TOO STRONG AND RECENT ALARM TO BEAR THE THOUGHT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0073 AND ANNE IN THE JOY OF THE ESCAPE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0074 COULD NOT HELP ADDING HER WARM PROTESTATIONS TO THEIRS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0075 CHARLES MUSGROVE INDEED AFTERWARDS SHEWED MORE OF INCLINATION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0076 THE CHILD WAS GOING ON SO WELL AND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0077 HE WISHED SO MUCH TO BE INTRODUCED TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0078 PERHAPS HE MIGHT JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0079 HE WOULD NOT DINE FROM HOME BUT HE MIGHT WALK IN FOR HALF AN HOUR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0080 BUT IN THIS HE WAS EAGERLY OPPOSED BY HIS WIFE WITH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0081 OH NO INDEED CHARLES I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO AWAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0082 ONLY THINK IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN THE CHILD HAD A GOOD NIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0083 AND WAS GOING ON WELL THE NEXT DAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0084 IT MUST BE A WORK OF TIME TO ASCERTAIN THAT NO INJURY HAD BEEN DONE TO THE SPINE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0085 BUT MR ROBINSON FOUND NOTHING TO INCREASE ALARM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0086 AND CHARLES MUSGROVE BEGAN CONSEQUENTLY TO FEEL NO NECESSITY FOR LONGER CONFINEMENT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0087 THE CHILD WAS TO BE KEPT IN BED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0088 AND AMUSED AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0089 BUT WHAT WAS THERE FOR A FATHER TO DO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0090 THIS WAS QUITE A FEMALE CASE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0091 AND IT WOULD BE HIGHLY ABSURD IN HIM WHO COULD BE OF NO USE AT HOME TO SHUT HIMSELF UP
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0092 HIS FATHER VERY MUCH WISHED HIM TO MEET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0093 AND THERE BEING NO SUFFICIENT REASON AGAINST IT HE OUGHT TO GO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0094 AND IT ENDED IN HIS MAKING A BOLD PUBLIC DECLARATION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0095 WHEN HE CAME IN FROM SHOOTING OF HIS MEANING TO DRESS DIRECTLY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0096 AND DINE AT THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0097 NOTHING CAN BE GOING ON BETTER THAN THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0098 SAID HE SO I TOLD MY FATHER JUST NOW THAT I WOULD COME
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0099 AND HE THOUGHT ME QUITE RIGHT YOUR SISTER BEING WITH YOU MY LOVE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0100 I HAVE NO SCRUPLE AT ALL YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIM YOURSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0101 BUT YOU SEE I CAN BE OF NO USE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0102 ANNE WILL SEND FOR ME IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0103 HUSBANDS AND WIVES GENERALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN OPPOSITION WILL BE VAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0104 MARY KNEW FROM CHARLES'S MANNER OF SPEAKING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0105 THAT HE WAS QUITE DETERMINED ON GOING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0106 AND THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO TEAZE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0107 SHE SAID NOTHING THEREFORE TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0108 BUT AS SOON AS THERE WAS ONLY ANNE TO HEAR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0109 SO YOU AND I ARE TO BE LEFT TO SHIFT BY OURSELVES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0110 WITH THIS POOR SICK CHILD AND NOT A CREATURE COMING NEAR US ALL THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0111 I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE THIS IS ALWAYS MY LUCK
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0112 IF THERE IS ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE GOING ON
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0113 MEN ARE ALWAYS SURE TO GET OUT OF IT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0114 AND CHARLES IS AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0115 VERY UNFEELING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0116 I MUST SAY IT IS VERY UNFEELING OF HIM TO BE RUNNING AWAY FROM HIS POOR LITTLE BOY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0117 TALKS OF HIS BEING GOING ON SO WELL HOW
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0118 DOES HE KNOW THAT HE IS GOING ON WELL OR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0119 THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A SUDDEN CHANGE HALF AN HOUR HENCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0120 I DID NOT THINK CHARLES WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UNFEELING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0121 SO HERE HE IS TO GO AWAY AND ENJOY HIMSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0122 AND BECAUSE I AM THE POOR MOTHER I AM NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO STIR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0123 AND YET I AM SURE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0124 I AM MORE UNFIT THAN ANYBODY ELSE TO BE ABOUT THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0125 MY BEING THE MOTHER IS THE VERY REASON WHY MY FEELINGS SHOULD NOT BE TRIED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0126 I AM NOT AT ALL EQUAL TO IT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0127 YOU SAW HOW HYSTERICAL I WAS YESTERDAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0128 BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE EFFECT OF THE SUDDENNESS OF YOUR ALARM OF THE SHOCK
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0129 YOU WILL NOT BE HYSTERICAL AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0130 I DARE SAY WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO DISTRESS US
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0131 I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND MR ROBINSON'S DIRECTIONS AND HAVE NO FEARS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0132 AND INDEED MARY I CANNOT WONDER AT YOUR HUSBAND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0133 NURSING DOES NOT BELONG TO A MAN IT IS NOT HIS PROVINCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0134 A SICK CHILD IS ALWAYS THE MOTHER'S PROPERTY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0135 HER OWN FEELINGS GENERALLY MAKE IT SO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0136 I HOPE I AM AS FOND OF MY CHILD AS ANY MOTHER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0137 BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM OF ANY MORE USE IN THE SICK ROOM THAN CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0138 FOR I CANNOT BE ALWAYS SCOLDING AND TEAZING THE POOR CHILD WHEN IT IS ILL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0139 AND YOU SAW THIS MORNING THAT IF I TOLD HIM TO KEEP QUIET
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0140 HE WAS SURE TO BEGIN KICKING ABOUT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0141 I HAVE NOT NERVES FOR THE SORT OF THING BUT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0142 COULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE YOURSELF

kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0171 IF I DID NOT FEEL QUITE AT EASE ABOUT MY DEAR CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0172 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS TAPPING AT HER HUSBAND'S DRESSING ROOM DOOR
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0173 AND AS ANNE FOLLOWED HER UP STAIRS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0174 SHE WAS IN TIME FOR THE WHOLE CONVERSATION WHICH BEGAN WITH MARY'S SAYING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0175 IN A TONE OF GREAT EXULTATION I MEAN TO GO WITH YOU CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0176 FOR I AM OF NO MORE USE AT HOME THAN YOU ARE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0177 IF I WERE TO SHUT MYSELF UP FOR EVER WITH THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0178 I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0179 ANNE WILL STAY ANNE UNDERTAKES TO STAY AT HOME
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0180 AND TAKE CARE OF HIM IT IS ANNE'S OWN PROPOSAL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0181 AND SO I SHALL GO WITH YOU
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0182 WHICH WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0183 FOR I HAVE NOT DINED AT THE OTHER HOUSE SINCE TUESDAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0184 THIS IS VERY KIND OF ANNE WAS HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0185 AND I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU GO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0186 BUT IT SEEMS RATHER HARD THAT SHE SHOULD BE LEFT AT HOME BY HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0187 TO NURSE OUR SICK CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0188 ANNE WAS NOW AT HAND TO TAKE UP HER OWN CAUSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0189 AND THE SINCERITY OF HER MANNER BEING SOON SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0190 WHERE CONVICTION WAS AT LEAST VERY AGREEABLE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0191 HE HAD NO FARTHER SCRUPLES AS TO HER BEING LEFT TO DINE ALONE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0192 THOUGH HE STILL WANTED HER TO JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0193 WHEN THE CHILD MIGHT BE AT REST FOR THE NIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0194 AND KINDLY URGED HER TO LET HIM COME AND FETCH HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0195 BUT SHE WAS QUITE UNPERSUADABLE AND THIS BEING THE CASE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0196 SHE HAD ERE LONG THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM SET OFF TOGETHER IN HIGH SPIRITS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0197 THEY WERE GONE SHE HOPED TO BE HAPPY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0198 HOWEVER ODDLY CONSTRUCTED SUCH HAPPINESS MIGHT SEEM AS FOR HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0199 SHE WAS LEFT WITH AS MANY SENSATIONS OF COMFORT AS WERE PERHAPS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0200 EVER LIKELY TO BE HERS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0201 SHE KNEW HERSELF TO BE OF THE FIRST UTILITY TO THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0202 AND WHAT WAS IT TO HER IF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0203 FREDERICK WENTWORTH WERE ONLY HALF A MILE DISTANT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0204 MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO OTHERS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0205 SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW HE FELT AS TO A MEETING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0206 PERHAPS INDIFFERENT IF INDIFFERENCE COULD EXIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0207 HE MUST BE EITHER INDIFFERENT OR UNWILLING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0208 HAD HE WISHED EVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0209 HE NEED NOT HAVE WAITED TILL THIS TIME
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0210 HE WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT SHE COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PLACE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0211 SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0212 WHEN EVENTS HAD BEEN EARLY GIVING HIM THE INDEPENDENCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0213 WHICH ALONE HAD BEEN WANTING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0214 HER BROTHER AND SISTER CAME BACK DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0215 AND THEIR VISIT IN GENERAL THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC SINGING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0216 TALKING LAUGHING ALL THAT WAS MOST AGREEABLE CHARMING MANNERS IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0217 NO SHYNESS OR RESERVE THEY SEEMED ALL TO KNOW EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0218 AND HE WAS COMING THE VERY NEXT MORNING TO SHOOT WITH CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0219 HE WAS TO COME TO BREAKFAST BUT NOT AT THE COTTAGE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0220 THOUGH THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT FIRST
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0221 BUT THEN HE HAD BEEN PRESSED TO COME TO THE GREAT HOUSE INSTEAD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0222 AND HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING IN MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE'S WAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0223 AND THEREFORE SOMEHOW THEY HARDLY KNEW HOW
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0224 IT ENDED IN CHARLES'S BEING TO MEET HIM TO BREAKFAST AT HIS FATHER'S
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0225 ANNE UNDERSTOOD IT HE WISHED TO AVOID SEEING HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0226 HE HAD INQUIRED AFTER HER SHE FOUND SLIGHTLY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0227 AS MIGHT SUIT A FORMER SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0228 SEEMING TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH AS SHE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED ACTUATED PERHAPS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0229 BY THE SAME VIEW OF ESCAPING INTRODUCTION WHEN THEY WERE TO MEET
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0230 THE MORNING HOURS OF THE COTTAGE WERE ALWAYS LATER THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0231 AND ON THE MORROW THE DIFFERENCE WAS SO GREAT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0232 THAT MARY AND ANNE WERE NOT MORE THAN BEGINNING BREAKFAST
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0233 WHEN CHARLES CAME IN TO SAY THAT THEY WERE JUST SETTING OFF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0234 THAT HE WAS COME FOR HIS DOGS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0235 THAT HIS SISTERS WERE FOLLOWING WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0236 HIS SISTERS MEANING TO VISIT MARY AND THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0237 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH PROPOSING ALSO TO WAIT ON HER FOR A FEW MINUTES IF NOT INCONVENIENT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0238 AND THOUGH CHARLES HAD ANSWERED FOR THE CHILD'S BEING IN NO SUCH STATE AS COULD MAKE IT INCONVENIENT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0239 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT HIS RUNNING ON TO GIVE NOTICE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0240 MARY VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THIS ATTENTION WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0241 WHILE A THOUSAND FEELINGS RUSHED ON ANNE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0242 OF WHICH THIS WAS THE MOST CONSOLING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0243 THAT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER AND IT WAS SOON OVER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0244 IN TWO MINUTES AFTER CHARLES'S PREPARATION THE OTHERS APPEARED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0245 THEY WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM HER EYE HALF MET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0246 A BOW A CURTSEY PASSED SHE HEARD HIS VOICE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0247 HE TALKED TO MARY SAID ALL THAT WAS RIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0248 SAID SOMETHING TO THE MISS MUSGROVES ENOUGH TO MARK AN EASY FOOTING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0249 THE ROOM SEEMED FULL FULL OF PERSONS AND VOICES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0250 BUT A FEW MINUTES ENDED IT CHARLES SHEWED HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0251 ALL WAS READY THEIR VISITOR HAD BOWED AND WAS GONE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0252 THE MISS MUSGROVES WERE GONE TOO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0253 SUDDENLY RESOLVING TO WALK TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE WITH THE SPORTSMEN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0254 THE ROOM WAS CLEARED AND ANNE MIGHT FINISH HER BREAKFAST AS SHE COULD IT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0255 IS OVER IT IS OVER SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NERVOUS GRATITUDE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0256 THE WORST IS OVER MARY TALKED BUT SHE COULD NOT ATTEND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0257 SHE HAD SEEN HIM THEY HAD MET
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0258 THEY HAD BEEN ONCE MORE IN THE SAME ROOM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0259 SOON HOWEVER SHE BEGAN TO REASON WITH HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0260 AND TRY TO BE FEELING LESS EIGHT YEARS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0261 ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE ALL HAD BEEN GIVEN UP
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0262 HOW ABSURD TO BE RESUMING THE AGITATION WHICH SUCH AN INTERVAL HAD BANISHED INTO DISTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0263 AND INDISTINCTNESS WHAT MIGHT NOT EIGHT YEARS DO EVENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0264 CHANGES ALIENATIONS REMOVALS ALL ALL MUST BE COMPRISED IN IT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0265 AND OBLIVION OF THE PAST HOW NATURAL HOW CERTAIN TOO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0266 IT INCLUDED NEARLY A THIRD PART OF HER OWN LIFE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0267 ALAS WITH ALL HER REASONING SHE FOUND THAT TO RETENTIVE FEELINGS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0268 EIGHT YEARS MAY BE LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0269 NOW HOW WERE HIS SENTIMENTS TO BE READ
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0270 WAS THIS LIKE WISHING TO AVOID HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0271 AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS HATING HERSELF FOR THE FOLLY WHICH ASKED THE QUESTION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0272 ON ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS HER UTMOST WISDOM MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVENTED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0273 SHE WAS SOON SPARED ALL SUSPENSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0274 FOR AFTER THE MISS MUSGROVES HAD RETURNED AND FINISHED THEIR VISIT AT THE COTTAGE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0275 SHE HAD THIS SPONTANEOUS INFORMATION FROM MARY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0276 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS NOT VERY GALLANT BY YOU ANNE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0277 THOUGH HE WAS SO ATTENTIVE TO ME
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0278 HENRIETTA ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN THEY WENT AWAY AND HE SAID
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0279 YOU WERE SO ALTERED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN YOU AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0280 MARY HAD NO FEELINGS TO MAKE HER RESPECT HER SISTER'S IN A COMMON WAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0281 BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF BEING INFLICTING ANY PECULIAR WOUND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0282 ALTERED BEYOND HIS KNOWLEDGE ANNE FULLY SUBMITTED IN SILENT DEEP MORTIFICATION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0283 DOUBTLESS IT WAS SO AND SHE COULD TAKE NO REVENGE FOR HE WAS NOT ALTERED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0284 OR NOT FOR THE WORSE SHE HAD ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0285 AND SHE COULD NOT THINK DIFFERENTLY LET HIM THINK OF HER AS HE WOULD
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0286 NO THE YEARS WHICH HAD DESTROYED HER YOUTH AND BLOOM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0287 HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM A MORE GLOWING MANLY OPEN LOOK
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0288 IN NO RESPECT LESSENING HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES SHE HAD SEEN THE SAME
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0289 FREDERICK WENTWORTH SO ALTERED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0290 THESE WERE WORDS WHICH COULD NOT BUT DWELL WITH HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0291 YET SHE SOON BEGAN TO REJOICE THAT SHE HAD HEARD THEM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0292 THEY WERE OF SOBERING TENDENCY THEY ALLAYED AGITATION THEY COMPOSED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0293 AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST MAKE HER HAPPIER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0294 FREDERICK WENTWORTH HAD USED SUCH WORDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0295 BUT WITHOUT AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE CARRIED ROUND TO HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0296 HE HAD THOUGHT HER WRETCHEDLY ALTERED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0297 AND IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF APPEAL HAD SPOKEN AS HE FELT
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0298 HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN ANNE ELLIOT SHE HAD USED HIM ILL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0299 DESERTED AND DISAPPOINTED HIM AND WORSE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0300 SHE HAD SHEWN A FEEBLENESS OF CHARACTER IN DOING SO
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0301 WHICH HIS OWN DECIDED CONFIDENT TEMPER COULD NOT ENDURE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0302 SHE HAD GIVEN HIM UP TO OBLIGE OTHERS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0303 IT HAD BEEN THE EFFECT OF OVER PERSUASION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0304 IT HAD BEEN WEAKNESS AND TIMIDITY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0305 HE HAD BEEN MOST WARMLY ATTACHED TO HER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0306 AND HAD NEVER SEEN A WOMAN SINCE WHOM HE THOUGHT HER EQUAL
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0307 BUT EXCEPT FROM SOME NATURAL SENSATION OF CURIOSITY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0308 HE HAD NO DESIRE OF MEETING HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0309 HER POWER WITH HIM WAS GONE FOR EVER
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0310 IT WAS NOW HIS OBJECT TO MARRY HE WAS RICH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0311 AND BEING TURNED ON SHORE FULLY INTENDED TO SETTLE AS SOON AS HE COULD BE PROPERLY TEMPTED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0312 ACTUALLY LOOKING ROUND
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0313 READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ALL THE SPEED WHICH A CLEAR HEAD AND A QUICK TASTE COULD ALLOW
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0314 HE HAD A HEART FOR EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES IF THEY COULD CATCH IT A
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0315 HEART IN SHORT FOR ANY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME IN HIS WAY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0316 EXCEPTING ANNE ELLIOT THIS WAS HIS ONLY SECRET EXCEPTION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0317 WHEN HE SAID TO HIS SISTER IN ANSWER TO HER SUPPOSITIONS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0318 YES HERE I AM SOPHIA QUITE READY TO MAKE A FOOLISH MATCH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0319 ANYBODY BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY MAY HAVE ME FOR ASKING
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0320 A LITTLE BEAUTY AND A FEW SMILES
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0321 AND A FEW COMPLIMENTS TO THE NAVY
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0322 AND I AM A LOST MAN
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0323 SHOULD NOT THIS BE ENOUGH FOR A SAILOR WHO HAS HAD NO SOCIETY AMONG WOMEN TO MAKE HIM NICE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0324 HE SAID IT SHE KNEW TO BE CONTRADICTED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0325 HIS BRIGHT PROUD EYE SPOKE THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS NICE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0326 AND ANNE ELLIOT WAS NOT OUT OF HIS THOUGHTS
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0327 WHEN HE MORE SERIOUSLY DESCRIBED THE WOMAN HE SHOULD WISH TO MEET WITH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0328 A STRONG MIND WITH SWEETNESS OF MANNER MADE THE FIRST
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0329 AND THE LAST OF THE DESCRIPTION
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0330 THAT IS THE WOMAN I WANT SAID HE
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0331 SOMETHING A LITTLE INFERIOR I SHALL OF COURSE PUT UP WITH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0332 BUT IT MUST NOT BE MUCH
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0333 IF I AM A FOOL I SHALL BE A FOOL INDEED
kayray-20070527-per07/wav/per0334 FOR I HAVE THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT MORE THAN MOST MEN

kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0005 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR WHO CAN BE IN DOUBT OF WHAT FOLLOWED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0006 WHEN ANY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO MARRY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0007 THEY ARE PRETTY SURE BY PERSEVERANCE TO CARRY THEIR POINT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0008 BE THEY EVER SO POOR OR EVER SO IMPRUDENT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0009 OR EVER SO LITTLE LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER'S ULTIMATE COMFORT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0010 THIS MAY BE BAD MORALITY TO CONCLUDE WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0011 BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0012 AND IF SUCH PARTIES SUCCEED HOW SHOULD A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0013 AND AN ANNE ELLIOT WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF MATURITY OF MIND
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0014 CONSCIOUSNESS OF RIGHT AND ONE INDEPENDENT FORTUNE BETWEEN THEM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0015 FAIL OF BEARING DOWN EVERY OPPOSITION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0016 THEY MIGHT IN FACT HAVE BORNE DOWN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEY MET WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0017 FOR THERE WAS LITTLE TO DISTRESS THEM BEYOND THE WANT OF GRACIOUSNESS AND WARMTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0018 SIR WALTER MADE NO OBJECTION AND ELIZABETH DID NOTHING WORSE THAN LOOK COLD
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0019 AND UNCONCERNED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WITH FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0020 AND AS HIGH IN HIS PROFESSION AS MERIT AND ACTIVITY COULD PLACE HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0021 WAS NO LONGER NOBODY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0022 HE WAS NOW ESTEEMED QUITE WORTHY TO ADDRESS THE DAUGHTER OF A FOOLISH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0023 SPENDTHRIFT BARONET WHO HAD NOT HAD PRINCIPLE OR SENSE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0024 IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD PLACED HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0025 AND WHO COULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AT PRESENT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0026 BUT A SMALL PART OF THE SHARE OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0027 WHICH MUST BE HERS HEREAFTER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0028 SIR WALTER INDEED THOUGH HE HAD NO AFFECTION FOR ANNE AND NO VANITY FLATTERED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0029 TO MAKE HIM REALLY HAPPY ON THE OCCASION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0030 WAS VERY FAR FROM THINKING IT A BAD MATCH FOR HER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0031 ON THE CONTRARY WHEN HE SAW MORE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0032 SAW HIM REPEATEDLY BY DAYLIGHT AND EYED HIM WELL
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0033 HE WAS VERY MUCH STRUCK BY HIS PERSONAL CLAIMS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0034 AND FELT THAT HIS SUPERIORITY OF APPEARANCE MIGHT BE NOT UNFAIRLY BALANCED AGAINST HER SUPERIORITY OF RANK
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0035 AND ALL THIS ASSISTED BY HIS WELL SOUNDING NAME
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0036 ENABLED SIR WALTER AT LAST TO PREPARE HIS PEN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0037 WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE FOR THE INSERTION OF THE MARRIAGE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0038 IN THE VOLUME OF HONOUR
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0039 THE ONLY ONE AMONG THEM WHOSE OPPOSITION OF FEELING COULD EXCITE ANY SERIOUS ANXIETY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0040 WAS LADY RUSSELL ANNE KNEW THAT LADY RUSSELL MUST BE SUFFERING SOME PAIN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0041 IN UNDERSTANDING AND RELINQUISHING MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0042 AND BE MAKING SOME STRUGGLES TO BECOME TRULY ACQUAINTED WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0043 AND DO JUSTICE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0044 THIS HOWEVER WAS WHAT LADY RUSSELL HAD NOW TO DO
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0045 SHE MUST LEARN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN WITH REGARD TO BOTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0046 THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY INFLUENCED BY APPEARANCES IN EACH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0047 THAT BECAUSE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNERS HAD NOT SUITED HER OWN IDEAS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0048 SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN SUSPECTING THEM TO INDICATE A CHARACTER OF DANGEROUS IMPETUOSITY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0049 AND THAT BECAUSE MR ELLIOT'S MANNERS HAD PRECISELY PLEASED HER IN THEIR PROPRIETY AND CORRECTNESS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0050 THEIR GENERAL POLITENESS AND SUAVITY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0051 SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN RECEIVING THEM AS THE CERTAIN RESULT OF THE MOST CORRECT OPINIONS AND WELL REGULATED MIND
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0052 THERE WAS NOTHING LESS FOR LADY RUSSELL TO DO
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0053 THAN TO ADMIT THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY COMPLETELY WRONG
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0054 AND TO TAKE UP A NEW SET OF OPINIONS AND OF HOPES
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0055 THERE IS A QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION IN SOME
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0056 A NICETY IN THE DISCERNMENT OF CHARACTER A NATURAL PENETRATION IN SHORT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0057 WHICH NO EXPERIENCE IN OTHERS CAN EQUAL
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0058 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD BEEN LESS GIFTED IN THIS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0059 BUT SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0060 AND IF HER SECOND OBJECT WAS TO BE SENSIBLE AND WELL JUDGING
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0061 HER FIRST WAS TO SEE ANNE HAPPY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0062 SHE LOVED ANNE BETTER THAN SHE LOVED HER OWN ABILITIES
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0063 AND WHEN THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE BEGINNING WAS OVER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0064 FOUND LITTLE HARDSHIP IN ATTACHING HERSELF AS A MOTHER TO THE MAN WHO WAS SECURING THE HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0065 OF HER OTHER CHILD
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0066 OF ALL THE FAMILY MARY WAS PROBABLY THE ONE MOST IMMEDIATELY GRATIFIED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0067 IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HAVE A SISTER MARRIED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0068 AND SHE MIGHT FLATTER HERSELF WITH HAVING BEEN GREATLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE CONNEXION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0069 BY KEEPING ANNE WITH HER IN THE AUTUMN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0070 AND AS HER OWN SISTER MUST BE BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND'S SISTERS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0071 IT WAS VERY AGREEABLE THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD BE A RICHER MAN THAN EITHER CAPTAIN BENWICK OR CHARLES HAYTER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0072 SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SUFFER PERHAPS WHEN THEY CAME INTO CONTACT AGAIN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0073 IN SEEING ANNE RESTORED TO THE RIGHTS OF SENIORITY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0074 AND THE MISTRESS OF A VERY PRETTY LANDAULETTE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0075 BUT SHE HAD A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO OF POWERFUL CONSOLATION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0076 ANNE HAD NO UPPERCROSS HALL BEFORE HER NO LANDED ESTATE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0077 NO HEADSHIP OF A FAMILY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0078 AND IF THEY COULD BUT KEEP CAPTAIN WENTWORTH FROM BEING MADE A BARONET
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0079 SHE WOULD NOT CHANGE SITUATIONS WITH ANNE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0080 IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE ELDEST SISTER IF SHE WERE EQUALLY SATISFIED WITH HER SITUATION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0081 FOR A CHANGE IS NOT VERY PROBABLE THERE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0082 SHE HAD SOON THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING MR ELLIOT WITHDRAW
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0083 AND NO ONE OF PROPER CONDITION HAS SINCE PRESENTED HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0084 TO RAISE EVEN THE UNFOUNDED HOPES WHICH SUNK WITH HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0085 THE NEWS OF HIS COUSINS ANNE'S ENGAGEMENT BURST ON MR ELLIOT MOST UNEXPECTEDLY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0086 IT DERANGED HIS BEST PLAN OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0087 HIS BEST HOPE OF KEEPING SIR WALTER SINGLE BY THE WATCHFULNESS WHICH A SON IN LAW'S RIGHTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0088 BUT THOUGH DISCOMFITED AND DISAPPOINTED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0089 HE COULD STILL DO SOMETHING FOR HIS OWN INTEREST AND HIS OWN ENJOYMENT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0090 HE SOON QUITTED BATH AND ON MRS CLAY'S QUITTING IT SOON AFTERWARDS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0091 AND BEING NEXT HEARD OF AS ESTABLISHED UNDER HIS PROTECTION IN LONDON
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0092 IT WAS EVIDENT HOW DOUBLE A GAME HE HAD BEEN PLAYING
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0093 AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0094 FROM BEING CUT OUT BY ONE ARTFUL WOMAN AT LEAST
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0095 MRS CLAY'S AFFECTIONS HAD OVERPOWERED HER INTEREST
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0096 AND SHE HAD SACRIFICED FOR THE YOUNG MAN'S SAKE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0097 THE POSSIBILITY OF SCHEMING LONGER FOR SIR WALTER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0098 SHE HAS ABILITIES HOWEVER AS WELL AS AFFECTIONS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0099 AND IT IS NOW A DOUBTFUL POINT WHETHER HIS CUNNING OR HERS MAY FINALLY CARRY THE DAY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0100 WHETHER AFTER PREVENTING HER FROM BEING THE WIFE OF SIR WALTER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0101 HE MAY NOT BE WHEEDLED AND CARESSED AT LAST
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0102 INTO MAKING HER THE WIFE OF SIR WILLIAM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0103 IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0104 WERE SHOCKED AND MORTIFIED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR COMPANION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0105 AND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR DECEPTION IN HER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0106 THEY HAD THEIR GREAT COUSINS TO BE SURE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0107 TO RESORT TO FOR COMFORT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0108 BUT THEY MUST LONG FEEL THAT TO FLATTER AND FOLLOW OTHERS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0109 WITHOUT BEING FLATTERED AND FOLLOWED IN TURN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0110 IS BUT A STATE OF HALF ENJOYMENT ANNE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0111 SATISFIED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OF LADY RUSSELL'S MEANING TO LOVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS SHE OUGHT
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0112 HAD NO OTHER ALLOY TO THE HAPPINESS OF HER PROSPECTS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0113 THAN WHAT AROSE FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING NO RELATIONS TO BESTOW ON HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0114 WHICH A MAN OF SENSE COULD VALUE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0115 THERE SHE FELT HER OWN INFERIORITY VERY KEENLY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0116 THE DISPROPORTION IN THEIR FORTUNE WAS NOTHING
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0117 IT DID NOT GIVE HER A MOMENT'S REGRET
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0118 BUT TO HAVE NO FAMILY TO RECEIVE AND ESTIMATE HIM PROPERLY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0119 NOTHING OF RESPECTABILITY OF HARMONY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0120 OF GOOD WILL TO OFFER IN RETURN FOR ALL THE WORTH AND ALL THE PROMPT WELCOME
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0121 WHICH MET HER IN HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0122 WAS A SOURCE OF AS LIVELY PAIN AS HER MIND COULD WELL BE SENSIBLE OF
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0123 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF OTHERWISE STRONG FELICITY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0124 SHE HAD BUT TWO FRIENDS IN THE WORLD TO ADD TO HIS LIST
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0125 LADY RUSSELL AND MRS SMITH TO THOSE HOWEVER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0126 HE WAS VERY WELL DISPOSED TO ATTACH HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0127 LADY RUSSELL IN SPITE OF ALL HER FORMER TRANSGRESSIONS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0128 HE COULD NOW VALUE FROM HIS HEART
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0129 WHILE HE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVED HER TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN ORIGINALLY DIVIDING THEM
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0130 HE WAS READY TO SAY ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER FAVOUR
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0131 AND AS FOR MRS SMITH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0132 SHE HAD CLAIMS OF VARIOUS KINDS TO RECOMMEND HER QUICKLY AND PERMANENTLY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0133 HER RECENT GOOD OFFICES BY ANNE HAD BEEN ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0134 AND THEIR MARRIAGE INSTEAD OF DEPRIVING HER OF ONE FRIEND
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0135 SECURED HER TWO SHE WAS THEIR EARLIEST VISITOR IN THEIR SETTLED LIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0136 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0137 BY PUTTING HER IN THE WAY OF RECOVERING HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY IN THE WEST INDIES
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0138 BY WRITING FOR HER ACTING FOR HER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0139 AND SEEING HER THROUGH ALL THE PETTY DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0140 WITH THE ACTIVITY AND EXERTION OF A FEARLESS MAN
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0141 AND A DETERMINED FRIEND FULLY REQUITED THE SERVICES WHICH SHE HAD RENDERED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0142 OR EVER MEANT TO RENDER TO HIS WIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0143 MRS SMITH'S ENJOYMENTS WERE NOT SPOILED BY THIS IMPROVEMENT OF INCOME
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0144 WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH AND THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH FRIENDS TO BE OFTEN WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0145 FOR HER CHEERFULNESS AND MENTAL ALACRITY DID NOT FAIL HER
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0146 AND WHILE THESE PRIME SUPPLIES OF GOOD REMAINED
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0147 SHE MIGHT HAVE BID DEFIANCE EVEN TO GREATER ACCESSIONS OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0148 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY RICH AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0149 AND YET BE HAPPY HER SPRING OF FELICITY WAS IN THE GLOW OF HER SPIRITS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0150 AS HER FRIEND ANNE'S WAS IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0151 ANNE WAS TENDERNESS ITSELF AND SHE HAD THE FULL WORTH OF IT IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S AFFECTION
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0152 HIS PROFESSION WAS ALL THAT COULD EVER MAKE HER FRIENDS WISH THAT TENDERNESS LESS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0153 THE DREAD OF A FUTURE WAR ALL THAT COULD DIM HER SUNSHINE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0154 SHE GLORIED IN BEING A SAILOR'S WIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0155 BUT SHE MUST PAY THE TAX OF QUICK ALARM FOR BELONGING TO THAT PROFESSION WHICH IS
kayray-20070529b-per24/wav/per0156 IF POSSIBLE MORE DISTINGUISHED IN ITS DOMESTIC VIRTUES THAN IN ITS NATIONAL

kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0005 SIR WALTER HIS TWO DAUGHTERS AND MRS CLAY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0006 WERE THE EARLIEST OF ALL THEIR PARTY AT THE ROOMS IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0007 AND AS LADY DALRYMPLE MUST BE WAITED FOR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0008 THEY TOOK THEIR STATION BY ONE OF THE FIRES IN THE OCTAGON ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0009 BUT HARDLY WERE THEY SO SETTLED WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0010 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED IN ALONE ANNE WAS THE NEAREST TO HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0011 AND MAKING YET A LITTLE ADVANCE SHE INSTANTLY SPOKE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0012 HE WAS PREPARING ONLY TO BOW AND PASS ON
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0013 BUT HER GENTLE HOW DO YOU DO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0014 BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE TO STAND NEAR HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0015 AND MAKE ENQUIRIES IN RETURN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0016 IN SPITE OF THE FORMIDABLE FATHER AND SISTER IN THE BACK GROUND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0017 THEIR BEING IN THE BACK GROUND WAS A SUPPORT TO ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0018 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR LOOKS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0019 AND FELT EQUAL TO EVERYTHING WHICH SHE BELIEVED RIGHT TO BE DONE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0020 WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING A WHISPERING BETWEEN HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH CAUGHT HER EAR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0021 SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH BUT SHE MUST GUESS THE SUBJECT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0022 AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MAKING A DISTANT BOW
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0023 SHE COMPREHENDED THAT HER FATHER HAD JUDGED SO WELL AS TO GIVE HIM THAT SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0024 AND SHE WAS JUST IN TIME BY A SIDE GLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0025 TO SEE A SLIGHT CURTSEY FROM ELIZABETH HERSELF THIS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0026 THOUGH LATE AND RELUCTANT AND UNGRACIOUS WAS YET BETTER THAN NOTHING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0027 AND HER SPIRITS IMPROVED AFTER TALKING HOWEVER OF THE WEATHER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0028 AND BATH AND THE CONCERT THEIR CONVERSATION BEGAN TO FLAG
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0029 AND SO LITTLE WAS SAID AT LAST THAT SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM TO GO EVERY MOMENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0030 BUT HE DID NOT HE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0031 AND PRESENTLY WITH RENEWED SPIRIT WITH A LITTLE SMILE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0032 A LITTLE GLOW HE SAID
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0033 I HAVE HARDLY SEEN YOU SINCE OUR DAY AT LYME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0034 I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE SHOCK
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0035 AND THE MORE FROM ITS NOT OVERPOWERING YOU AT THE TIME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0036 SHE ASSURED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0037 IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL HOUR SAID HE A FRIGHTFUL DAY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0038 AND HE PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0039 AS IF THE REMEMBRANCE WERE STILL TOO PAINFUL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0040 BUT IN A MOMENT HALF SMILING AGAIN ADDED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0041 THE DAY HAS PRODUCED SOME EFFECTS HOWEVER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0042 HAS HAD SOME CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0043 AS THE VERY REVERSE OF FRIGHTFUL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0044 WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO SUGGEST THAT BENWICK WOULD BE THE PROPEREST PERSON TO FETCH A SURGEON
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0045 YOU COULD HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF HIS BEING EVENTUALLY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0046 ONE OF THOSE MOST CONCERNED IN HER RECOVERY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0047 CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE NONE BUT IT APPEARS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0048 I SHOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE A VERY HAPPY MATCH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0049 THERE ARE ON BOTH SIDES GOOD PRINCIPLES AND GOOD TEMPER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0050 YES SAID HE LOOKING NOT EXACTLY FORWARD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0051 BUT THERE I THINK ENDS THE RESEMBLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0052 WITH ALL MY SOUL I WISH THEM HAPPY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0053 AND REJOICE OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0054 THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH AT HOME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0055 NO OPPOSITION NO CAPRICE NO DELAYS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0056 THE MUSGROVES ARE BEHAVING LIKE THEMSELVES MOST HONOURABLY AND KINDLY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0057 ONLY ANXIOUS WITH TRUE PARENTAL HEARTS TO PROMOTE THEIR DAUGHTER'S COMFORT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0058 ALL THIS IS MUCH VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THEIR HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0059 MORE THAN PERHAPS HE STOPPED A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO OCCUR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0060 AND TO GIVE HIM SOME TASTE OF THAT EMOTION WHICH WAS REDDENING ANNE'S CHEEKS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0061 AND FIXING HER EYES ON THE GROUND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0062 AFTER CLEARING HIS THROAT HOWEVER HE PROCEEDED THUS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0063 I CONFESS THAT I DO THINK THERE IS A DISPARITY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0064 TOO GREAT A DISPARITY AND IN A POINT NO LESS ESSENTIAL THAN MIND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0065 I REGARD LOUISA MUSGROVE AS A VERY AMIABLE SWEET TEMPERED GIRL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0066 AND NOT DEFICIENT IN UNDERSTANDING BUT BENWICK IS SOMETHING MORE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0067 HE IS A CLEVER MAN A READING MAN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0068 AND I CONFESS THAT I DO CONSIDER HIS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO HER WITH SOME SURPRISE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0069 HAD IT BEEN THE EFFECT OF GRATITUDE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0070 HAD HE LEARNT TO LOVE HER BECAUSE HE BELIEVED HER TO BE PREFERRING HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0071 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER THING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0072 BUT I HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT SO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0073 IT SEEMS ON THE CONTRARY TO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0074 HAVE BEEN A PERFECTLY SPONTANEOUS UNTAUGHT FEELING ON HIS SIDE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0075 AND THIS SURPRISES ME A MAN LIKE HIM IN HIS SITUATION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0076 WITH A HEART PIERCED WOUNDED ALMOST BROKEN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0077 FANNY HARVILLE WAS A VERY SUPERIOR CREATURE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0078 AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER WAS INDEED ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0079 A MAN DOES NOT RECOVER FROM SUCH A DEVOTION OF THE HEART TO SUCH A WOMAN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0080 HE OUGHT NOT HE DOES NOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0081 EITHER FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS HOWEVER THAT HIS FRIEND HAD RECOVERED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0082 OR FROM OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS HE WENT NO FARTHER AND ANNE WHO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0083 IN SPITE OF THE AGITATED VOICE IN WHICH THE LATTER PART HAD BEEN UTTERED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0084 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0085 THE ALMOST CEASELESS SLAM OF THE DOOR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0086 AND CEASELESS BUZZ OF PERSONS WALKING THROUGH HAD DISTINGUISHED EVERY WORD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0087 WAS STRUCK GRATIFIED CONFUSED AND BEGINNING TO BREATHE VERY QUICK
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0088 AND FEEL AN HUNDRED THINGS IN A MOMENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0089 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ENTER ON SUCH A SUBJECT AND YET
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0090 AFTER A PAUSE FEELING THE NECESSITY OF SPEAKING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0091 AND HAVING NOT THE SMALLEST WISH FOR A TOTAL CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0092 SHE ONLY DEVIATED SO FAR AS TO SAY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0093 YOU WERE A GOOD WHILE AT LYME I THINK
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0094 ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I COULD NOT LEAVE IT TILL LOUISA'S DOING WELL WAS QUITE ASCERTAINED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0095 I HAD BEEN TOO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE MISCHIEF TO BE SOON AT PEACE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0096 IT HAD BEEN MY DOING SOLELY MINE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBSTINATE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0097 IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK THE COUNTRY ROUND LYME IS VERY FINE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0098 I WALKED AND RODE A GREAT DEAL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0099 AND THE MORE I SAW THE MORE I FOUND TO ADMIRE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0100 I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE LYME AGAIN SAID ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0101 INDEED I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOUND ANYTHING IN LYME TO INSPIRE SUCH A FEELING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0102 THE HORROR AND DISTRESS YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE STRETCH OF MIND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0103 THE WEAR OF SPIRITS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0104 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOUR LAST IMPRESSIONS OF LYME MUST HAVE BEEN STRONG DISGUST
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0105 THE LAST HOURS WERE CERTAINLY VERY PAINFUL REPLIED ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0106 BUT WHEN PAIN IS OVER THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT OFTEN BECOMES A PLEASURE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0107 ONE DOES NOT LOVE A PLACE THE LESS FOR HAVING SUFFERED IN IT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0108 UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ALL SUFFERING NOTHING BUT SUFFERING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0109 WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE AT LYME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0110 WE WERE ONLY IN ANXIETY AND DISTRESS DURING THE LAST TWO HOURS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0111 AND PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0112 SO MUCH NOVELTY AND BEAUTY I HAVE TRAVELLED SO LITTLE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0113 THAT EVERY FRESH PLACE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0114 BUT THERE IS REAL BEAUTY AT LYME AND IN SHORT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0115 WITH A FAINT BLUSH AT SOME RECOLLECTIONS ALTOGETHER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0116 MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE PLACE ARE VERY AGREEABLE AS SHE CEASED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0117 THE ENTRANCE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND THE VERY PARTY APPEARED FOR WHOM THEY WERE WAITING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0118 LADY DALRYMPLE LADY DALRYMPLE WAS THE REJOICING SOUND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0119 AND WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS COMPATIBLE WITH ANXIOUS ELEGANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0120 SIR WALTER AND HIS TWO LADIES STEPPED FORWARD TO MEET HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0121 LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET ESCORTED BY MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0122 AND COLONEL WALLIS WHO HAD HAPPENED TO ARRIVE NEARLY AT THE SAME INSTANT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0123 ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM THE OTHERS JOINED THEM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0124 AND IT WAS A GROUP IN WHICH ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALSO NECESSARILY INCLUDED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0125 SHE WAS DIVIDED FROM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THEIR INTERESTING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0126 ALMOST TOO INTERESTING CONVERSATION MUST BE BROKEN UP FOR A TIME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0127 BUT SLIGHT WAS THE PENANCE COMPARED WITH THE HAPPINESS WHICH BROUGHT IT ON
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0128 SHE HAD LEARNT IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0129 MORE OF HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS LOUISA
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0130 MORE OF ALL HIS FEELINGS THAN SHE DARED TO THINK OF
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0131 AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE DEMANDS OF THE PARTY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0132 TO THE NEEDFUL CIVILITIES OF THE MOMENT WITH EXQUISITE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0133 THOUGH AGITATED SENSATIONS SHE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH ALL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0134 SHE HAD RECEIVED IDEAS WHICH DISPOSED HER TO BE COURTEOUS AND KIND TO ALL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0135 AND TO PITY EVERY ONE AS BEING LESS HAPPY THAN HERSELF
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0136 THE DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS WERE A LITTLE SUBDUED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0137 WHEN ON STEPPING BACK FROM THE GROUP TO BE JOINED AGAIN BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0138 SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GONE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0139 SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIM TURN INTO THE CONCERT ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0140 HE WAS GONE HE HAD DISAPPEARED SHE FELT A MOMENT'S REGRET
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0141 BUT THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN HE WOULD LOOK FOR HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0142 HE WOULD FIND HER OUT BEFORE THE EVENING WERE OVER AND AT PRESENT PERHAPS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0143 IT WAS AS WELL TO BE ASUNDER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0144 SHE WAS IN NEED OF A LITTLE INTERVAL FOR RECOLLECTION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0145 UPON LADY RUSSELL'S APPEARANCE SOON AFTERWARDS THE WHOLE PARTY WAS COLLECTED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0146 AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO MARSHAL THEMSELVES AND PROCEED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0147 AND BE OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCE IN THEIR POWER DRAW AS MANY EYES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0148 EXCITE AS MANY WHISPERS AND DISTURB AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY COULD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0149 VERY VERY HAPPY WERE BOTH ELIZABETH AND ANNE ELLIOT AS THEY WALKED IN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0150 ELIZABETH ARM IN ARM WITH MISS CARTERET
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0151 AND LOOKING ON THE BROAD BACK OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE BEFORE HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0152 HAD NOTHING TO WISH FOR WHICH DID NOT SEEM WITHIN HER REACH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0153 AND ANNE BUT IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO THE NATURE OF ANNE'S FELICITY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0154 TO DRAW ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN IT AND HER SISTER'S
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0155 THE ORIGIN OF ONE ALL SELFISH VANITY OF THE OTHER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0156 ALL GENEROUS ATTACHMENT ANNE SAW NOTHING THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE BRILLIANCY OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0157 HER HAPPINESS WAS FROM WITHIN HER EYES WERE BRIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0158 AND HER CHEEKS GLOWED BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0159 SHE WAS THINKING ONLY OF THE LAST HALF HOUR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0160 AND AS THEY PASSED TO THEIR SEATS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0161 HER MIND TOOK A HASTY RANGE OVER IT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0162 HIS CHOICE OF SUBJECTS HIS EXPRESSIONS AND STILL MORE HIS MANNER AND LOOK
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0163 HAD BEEN SUCH AS SHE COULD SEE IN ONLY ONE LIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0164 HIS OPINION OF LOUISA MUSGROVE'S INFERIORITY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0165 AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD SEEMED SOLICITOUS TO GIVE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0166 HIS WONDER AT CAPTAIN BENWICK HIS FEELINGS AS TO A FIRST STRONG ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0167 SENTENCES BEGUN WHICH HE COULD NOT FINISH HIS HALF AVERTED EYES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0168 AND MORE THAN HALF EXPRESSIVE GLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0169 ALL ALL DECLARED THAT HE HAD A HEART RETURNING TO HER AT LEAST
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0170 THAT ANGER RESENTMENT AVOIDANCE WERE NO MORE AND THAT THEY WERE SUCCEEDED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0171 NOT MERELY BY FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD BUT BY THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0172 YES SOME SHARE OF THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0173 SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGE AS IMPLYING LESS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0174 HE MUST LOVE HER THESE WERE THOUGHTS WITH THEIR ATTENDANT VISIONS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0175 WHICH OCCUPIED AND FLURRIED HER TOO MUCH TO LEAVE HER ANY POWER OF OBSERVATION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0176 AND SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROOM WITHOUT HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0177 WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO DISCERN HIM WHEN THEIR PLACES WERE DETERMINED ON
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0178 AND THEY WERE ALL PROPERLY ARRANGED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0179 SHE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME PART OF THE ROOM BUT HE WAS NOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0180 HER EYE COULD NOT REACH HIM AND THE CONCERT BEING JUST OPENING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0181 SHE MUST CONSENT FOR A TIME TO BE HAPPY IN A HUMBLER WAY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0182 THE PARTY WAS DIVIDED AND DISPOSED OF ON TWO CONTIGUOUS BENCHES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0183 ANNE WAS AMONG THOSE ON THE FOREMOST
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0184 AND MR ELLIOT HAD MANOEUVRED SO WELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0185 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0186 AS TO HAVE A SEAT BY HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0187 MISS ELLIOT SURROUNDED BY HER COUSINS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0188 AND THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF COLONEL WALLIS'S GALLANTRY WAS QUITE CONTENTED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0189 ANNE'S MIND WAS IN A MOST FAVOURABLE STATE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE EVENING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0190 IT WAS JUST OCCUPATION ENOUGH SHE HAD FEELINGS FOR THE TENDER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0191 SPIRITS FOR THE GAY ATTENTION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0192 AND PATIENCE FOR THE WEARISOME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0193 AND HAD NEVER LIKED A CONCERT BETTER AT LEAST DURING THE FIRST ACT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0194 TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF IT IN THE INTERVAL SUCCEEDING AN ITALIAN SONG
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0195 SHE EXPLAINED THE WORDS OF THE SONG TO MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0196 THEY HAD A CONCERT BILL BETWEEN THEM THIS SAID SHE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0197 IS NEARLY THE SENSE OR RATHER THE MEANING OF THE WORDS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0198 FOR CERTAINLY THE SENSE OF AN ITALIAN LOVE SONG MUST NOT BE TALKED OF
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0199 BUT IT IS AS NEARLY THE MEANING AS I CAN GIVE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0200 FOR I DO NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0201 I AM A VERY POOR ITALIAN SCHOLAR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0202 YES YES I SEE YOU ARE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0203 I SEE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0204 YOU HAVE ONLY KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH OF THE LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE AT SIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0205 THESE INVERTED TRANSPOSED CURTAILED ITALIAN LINES INTO CLEAR COMPREHENSIBLE ELEGANT ENGLISH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0206 YOU NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE OF YOUR IGNORANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0207 HERE IS COMPLETE PROOF I WILL NOT OPPOSE SUCH KIND POLITENESS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0208 BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE EXAMINED BY A REAL PROFICIENT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0209 I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING IN CAMDEN PLACE SO LONG REPLIED HE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0210 WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0211 AND I DO REGARD HER AS ONE WHO IS TOO MODEST FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO BE AWARE OF HALF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0212 AND TOO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR MODESTY TO BE NATURAL IN ANY OTHER WOMAN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0213 FOR SHAME FOR SHAME THIS IS TOO MUCH FLATTERY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0214 I FORGET WHAT WE ARE TO HAVE NEXT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0215 TURNING TO THE BILL PERHAPS SAID MR ELLIOT SPEAKING LOW
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0216 I HAVE HAD A LONGER ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR CHARACTER THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0217 INDEED HOW SO YOU CAN HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH IT ONLY SINCE I CAME TO BATH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0218 EXCEPTING AS YOU MIGHT HEAR ME PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF IN MY OWN FAMILY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0219 I KNEW YOU BY REPORT LONG BEFORE YOU CAME TO BATH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0220 I HAD HEARD YOU DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO KNEW YOU INTIMATELY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0221 I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU BY CHARACTER MANY YEARS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0222 YOUR PERSON YOUR DISPOSITION ACCOMPLISHMENTS MANNER THEY WERE ALL PRESENT TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0223 MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST HE HOPED TO RAISE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0224 NO ONE CAN WITHSTAND THE CHARM OF SUCH A MYSTERY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0225 TO HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED LONG AGO TO A RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0226 BY NAMELESS PEOPLE IS IRRESISTIBLE AND ANNE WAS ALL CURIOSITY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0227 SHE WONDERED AND QUESTIONED HIM EAGERLY BUT IN VAIN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0228 HE DELIGHTED IN BEING ASKED BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0229 NO NO SOME TIME OR OTHER PERHAPS BUT NOT NOW
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0230 HE WOULD MENTION NO NAMES NOW BUT SUCH HE COULD ASSURE HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0231 HAD BEEN THE FACT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0232 HE HAD MANY YEARS AGO RECEIVED SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0233 AS HAD INSPIRED HIM WITH THE HIGHEST IDEA OF HER MERIT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0234 AND EXCITED THE WARMEST CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0235 ANNE COULD THINK OF NO ONE SO LIKELY TO HAVE SPOKEN WITH PARTIALITY OF HER MANY YEARS AGO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0236 AS THE MR WENTWORTH OF MONKFORD CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S BROTHER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0237 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0238 BUT SHE HAD NOT COURAGE TO ASK THE QUESTION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0239 THE NAME OF ANNE ELLIOT SAID HE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0240 HAS LONG HAD AN INTERESTING SOUND TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0241 VERY LONG HAS IT POSSESSED A CHARM OVER MY FANCY AND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0242 IF I DARED I WOULD BREATHE MY WISHES THAT THE NAME MIGHT NEVER CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0243 SUCH SHE BELIEVED WERE HIS WORDS BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE RECEIVED THEIR SOUND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0244 THAN HER ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY OTHER SOUNDS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0245 WHICH RENDERED EVERY THING ELSE TRIVIAL HER FATHER AND LADY DALRYMPLE WERE SPEAKING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0246 A WELL LOOKING MAN SAID SIR WALTER A VERY WELL LOOKING MAN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0247 A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED SAID LADY DALRYMPLE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0248 MORE AIR THAN ONE OFTEN SEES IN BATH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0249 IRISH I DARE SAY NO I JUST KNOW HIS NAME
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0250 A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE WENTWORTH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF THE NAVY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0251 HIS SISTER MARRIED MY TENANT IN SOMERSETSHIRE THE CROFT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0252 WHO RENTS KELLYNCH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0253 BEFORE SIR WALTER HAD REACHED THIS POINT ANNE'S EYES HAD CAUGHT THE RIGHT DIRECTION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0254 AND DISTINGUISHED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH STANDING AMONG A CLUSTER OF MEN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0255 AS HER EYES FELL ON HIM HIS SEEMED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0256 IT HAD THAT APPEARANCE IT SEEMED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ONE MOMENT TOO LATE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0257 AND AS LONG AS SHE DARED OBSERVE HE DID NOT LOOK AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0258 BUT THE PERFORMANCE WAS RECOMMENCING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0259 AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SEEM TO RESTORE HER ATTENTION TO THE ORCHESTRA
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0260 AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEN SHE COULD GIVE ANOTHER GLANCE HE HAD MOVED AWAY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0261 HE COULD NOT HAVE COME NEARER TO HER IF HE WOULD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0262 SHE WAS SO SURROUNDED AND SHUT IN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0263 BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CAUGHT HIS EYE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0264 MR ELLIOT'S SPEECH TOO DISTRESSED HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0265 SHE HAD NO LONGER ANY INCLINATION TO TALK TO HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0266 SHE WISHED HIM NOT SO NEAR HER THE FIRST ACT WAS OVER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0267 NOW SHE HOPED FOR SOME BENEFICIAL CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0268 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF NOTHING SAYING AMONGST THE PARTY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0269 SOME OF THEM DID DECIDE ON GOING IN QUEST OF TEA
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0270 ANNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW WHO DID NOT CHOOSE TO MOVE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0271 SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT AND SO DID LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0272 BUT SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING RID OF MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0273 AND SHE DID NOT MEAN WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL ON LADY RUSSELL'S ACCOUNT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0274 TO SHRINK FROM CONVERSATION WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IF HE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0275 SHE WAS PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0276 HE DID NOT COME HOWEVER ANNE SOMETIMES FANCIED SHE DISCERNED HIM AT A DISTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0277 BUT HE NEVER CAME THE ANXIOUS INTERVAL WORE AWAY UNPRODUCTIVELY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0278 THE OTHERS RETURNED THE ROOM FILLED AGAIN BENCHES WERE RECLAIMED AND REPOSSESSED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0279 AND ANOTHER HOUR OF PLEASURE OR OF PENANCE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0280 WAS TO BE SAT OUT ANOTHER HOUR OF MUSIC WAS TO GIVE DELIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0281 OR THE GAPES AS REAL OR AFFECTED TASTE FOR IT PREVAILED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0282 TO ANNE IT CHIEFLY WORE THE PROSPECT OF AN HOUR OF AGITATION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0283 SHE COULD NOT QUIT THAT ROOM IN PEACE WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH ONCE MORE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0284 WITHOUT THE INTERCHANGE OF ONE FRIENDLY LOOK
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0285 IN RE SETTLING THEMSELVES THERE WERE NOW MANY CHANGES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0286 THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS FAVOURABLE FOR HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0287 COLONEL WALLIS DECLINED SITTING DOWN AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0288 AND MR ELLIOT WAS INVITED BY ELIZABETH AND MISS CARTERET
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0289 IN A MANNER NOT TO BE REFUSED TO SIT BETWEEN THEM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0290 AND BY SOME OTHER REMOVALS AND A LITTLE SCHEMING OF HER OWN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0291 ANNE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HERSELF MUCH NEARER THE END OF THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0292 THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE MUCH MORE WITHIN REACH OF A PASSER BY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0293 SHE COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT COMPARING HERSELF WITH MISS LAROLLES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0294 THE INIMITABLE MISS LAROLLES BUT STILL SHE DID
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0295 IT AND NOT WITH MUCH HAPPIER EFFECT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0296 THOUGH BY WHAT SEEMED PROSPERITY IN THE SHAPE OF AN EARLY ABDICATION IN HER NEXT NEIGHBOURS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0297 SHE FOUND HERSELF AT THE VERY END OF THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0298 BEFORE THE CONCERT CLOSED SUCH WAS HER SITUATION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0299 WITH A VACANT SPACE AT HAND WHEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS AGAIN IN SIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0300 SHE SAW HIM NOT FAR OFF HE SAW HER TOO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0301 YET HE LOOKED GRAVE AND SEEMED IRRESOLUTE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0302 AND ONLY BY VERY SLOW DEGREES CAME AT LAST NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO HER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0303 SHE FELT THAT SOMETHING MUST BE THE MATTER THE CHANGE WAS INDUBITABLE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0304 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS PRESENT AIR AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE OCTAGON ROOM WAS STRIKINGLY GREAT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0305 WHY WAS IT SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER OF LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0306 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY UNPLEASANT GLANCES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0307 HE BEGAN BY SPEAKING OF THE CONCERT GRAVELY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0308 MORE LIKE THE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF UPPERCROSS OWNED HIMSELF DISAPPOINTED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0309 HAD EXPECTED SINGING AND IN SHORT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0310 MUST CONFESS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0311 ANNE REPLIED AND SPOKE IN DEFENCE OF THE PERFORMANCE SO WELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0312 AND YET IN ALLOWANCE FOR HIS FEELINGS SO PLEASANTLY
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0313 THAT HIS COUNTENANCE IMPROVED AND HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH ALMOST A SMILE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0314 THEY TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE THE IMPROVEMENT HELD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0315 HE EVEN LOOKED DOWN TOWARDS THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0316 AS IF HE SAW A PLACE ON IT WELL WORTH OCCUPYING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0317 WHEN AT THAT MOMENT A TOUCH ON HER SHOULDER OBLIGED ANNE TO TURN ROUND
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0318 IT CAME FROM MR ELLIOT HE BEGGED HER PARDON
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0319 BUT SHE MUST BE APPLIED TO TO EXPLAIN ITALIAN AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0320 MISS CARTERET WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE SUNG
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0321 ANNE COULD NOT REFUSE BUT NEVER HAD SHE SACRIFICED TO POLITENESS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0322 WITH A MORE SUFFERING SPIRIT A FEW MINUTES
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0323 THOUGH AS FEW AS POSSIBLE WERE INEVITABLY CONSUMED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0324 AND WHEN HER OWN MISTRESS AGAIN WHEN ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0325 SHE FOUND HERSELF ACCOSTED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0326 IN A RESERVED YET HURRIED SORT OF FAREWELL
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0327 HE MUST WISH HER GOOD NIGHT HE WAS GOING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0328 HE SHOULD GET HOME AS FAST AS HE COULD
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0329 IS NOT THIS SONG WORTH STAYING FOR SAID ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0330 SUDDENLY STRUCK BY AN IDEA WHICH MADE HER YET MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ENCOURAGING
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0331 NO HE REPLIED IMPRESSIVELY THERE IS NOTHING WORTH MY STAYING FOR
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0332 AND HE WAS GONE DIRECTLY JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0333 IT WAS THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE MOTIVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH JEALOUS OF HER AFFECTION
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0334 COULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED IT A WEEK AGO THREE HOURS AGO
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0335 FOR A MOMENT THE GRATIFICATION WAS EXQUISITE
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0336 BUT ALAS THERE WERE VERY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS TO SUCCEED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0337 HOW WAS SUCH JEALOUSY TO BE QUIETED
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0338 HOW WAS THE TRUTH TO REACH HIM
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0339 HOW IN ALL THE PECULIAR DISADVANTAGES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SITUATIONS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0340 WOULD HE EVER LEARN OF HER REAL SENTIMENTS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0341 IT WAS MISERY TO THINK OF MR ELLIOT'S ATTENTIONS
kayray-20070529-per20/wav/per0342 THEIR EVIL WAS INCALCULABLE END OF CHAPTER TWENTY

kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0013 SO TILL AT LAST THERE WAS ONLY ONE SMALL FISH LEFT IN ALL THE SEA
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0014 AND HE WAS A SMALL STUTE FISH
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0015 AND HE SWAM A LITTLE BEHIND THE WHALE'S RIGHT EAR
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0016 SO AS TO BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0017 THEN THE WHALE STOOD UP ON HIS TAIL AND SAID
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0018 I'M HUNGRY AND THE SMALL STUTE FISH SAID IN A SMALL STUTE

kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0040 BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF INFINITE RESOURCE AND SAGACITY
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0041 THEN THE WHALE OPENED HIS MOUTH BACK AND BACK AND BACK
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0042 TILL IT NEARLY TOUCHED HIS TAIL AND HE SWALLOWED THE SHIPWRECKED MARINER
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0043 AND THE RAFT HE WAS SITTING ON

kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0061 SAID THE STUTE FISH SO
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0062 THE WHALE CALLED DOWN HIS OWN THROAT TO THE SHIPWRECKED MARINER

kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0067 YOU HAD BETTER TAKE HIM HOME SAID THE STUTE FISH TO THE WHALE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0068 I OUGHT TO HAVE WARNED YOU THAT HE IS A MAN OF INFINITE RESOURCE AND SAGACITY
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0069 SO THE WHALE SWAM AND SWAM AND SWAM

kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0071 HARD AS HE COULD FOR THE HICCOUGHS
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0072 AND AT LAST HE SAW THE MARINER'S NATAL SHORE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0073 AND THE WHITE CLIFFS OF ALBION AND HE RUSHED HALF WAY UP
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0074 THE BEACH AND OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDE AND WIDE AND WIDE AND SAID
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0075 CHANGE HERE FOR WINCHESTER ASHUELOT NASHUA KEENE AND STATIONS ON THE FITCHBURG ROAD
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0076 AND JUST AS HE SAID FITCH THE MARINER WALKED OUT OF HIS MOUTH
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0077 BUT WHILE THE WHALE HAD BEEN SWIMMING
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0078 THE MARINER WHO WAS INDEED A PERSON OF INFINITE RESOURCE AND SAGACITY
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0079 HAD TAKEN HIS JACK KNIFE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0080 AND CUT UP THE RAFT INTO A LITTLE SQUARE GRATING ALL RUNNING CRISS CROSS
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0081 AND HE HAD TIED IT FIRM WITH HIS SUSPENDERS
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0082 NOW YOU KNOW WHY YOU WERE NOT TO FORGET
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0083 THE SUSPENDERS AND HE DRAGGED THAT GRATING GOOD AND
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0084 TIGHT INTO THE WHALE'S THROAT AND THERE IT STUCK
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0085 THEN HE RECITED THE FOLLOWING SLOKA WHICH AS YOU HAVE NOT HEARD IT
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0086 I WILL NOW PROCEED TO RELATE BY MEANS OF A GRATING
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0087 I HAVE STOPPED YOUR ATING FOR THE MARINER HE WAS ALSO AN HIBERNIAN
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0088 AND HE STEPPED OUT ON THE SHINGLE AND WENT HOME TO HIS MOTHER
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0089 WHO HAD GIVEN HIM LEAVE TO TRAIL HIS TOES IN THE WATER
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0090 AND HE MARRIED AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARD SO DID THE WHALE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0091 BUT FROM THAT DAY ON THE GRATING IN HIS THROAT
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0092 WHICH HE COULD NEITHER COUGH UP NOR SWALLOW DOWN
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0093 PREVENTED HIM EATING ANYTHING EXCEPT VERY VERY SMALL FISH
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0094 AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY WHALES NOWADAYS NEVER EAT MEN
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0095 OR BOYS OR LITTLE GIRLS
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0096 THE SMALL STUTE FISH WENT AND HID HIMSELF IN THE MUD UNDER THE DOOR SILLS OF THE EQUATOR
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0097 HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE WHALE MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0098 HIM THE SAILOR TOOK THE JACK KNIFE HOME
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0099 HE WAS WEARING THE BLUE CANVAS BREECHES WHEN HE WALKED OUT ON THE SHINGLE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0100 THE SUSPENDERS WERE LEFT BEHIND YOU SEE TO TIE THE GRATING WITH
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0101 AND THAT IS THE END OF THAT TALE
kayray-20070604-wha/wav/wha0102 WHEN THE CABIN PORT HOLES ARE DARK AND GREEN BECAUSE OF THE SEAS OUTSIDE

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0050 ALL SET ABOUT WITH FEVER TREES
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0051 TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CROCODILE HAS FOR DINNER
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0052 AND THEY ALL SPANKED HIM ONCE MORE FOR LUCK
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0053 THOUGH HE ASKED THEM MOST POLITELY TO STOP
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0054 THEN HE WENT AWAY A LITTLE WARM BUT NOT AT ALL ASTONISHED
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0055 EATING MELONS AND THROWING THE RIND ABOUT
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0056 BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PICK IT UP
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0057 HE WENT FROM GRAHAM'S TOWN TO KIMBERLEY AND FROM KIMBERLEY TO KHAMA'S COUNTRY
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0058 AND FROM KHAMA'S COUNTRY HE WENT EAST BY NORTH
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0059 EATING MELONS ALL THE TIME
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0060 TILL AT LAST HE CAME TO THE BANKS OF THE GREAT GREY GREEN GREASY LIMPOPO RIVER
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0061 ALL SET ABOUT WITH FEVER TREES PRECISELY AS KOLOKOLO BIRD HAD SAID
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0062 NOW YOU MUST KNOW AND UNDERSTAND O BEST BELOVED THAT
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0063 TILL THAT VERY WEEK AND DAY AND HOUR AND MINUTE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0064 THIS SATIABLE ELEPHANT'S CHILD HAD NEVER SEEN A CROCODILE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0065 AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT ONE WAS LIKE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0066 IT WAS ALL HIS SATIABLE CURTIOSITY
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0067 THE FIRST THING THAT HE FOUND WAS A BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0068 CURLED ROUND A ROCK SCUSE ME SAID THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD MOST POLITELY
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0069 BUT HAVE YOU SEEN SUCH A THING AS A CROCODILE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0070 IN THESE PROMISCUOUS PARTS HAVE I SEEN A CROCODILE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0071 SAID THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE IN A VOICE OF
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0072 DRETFUL SCORN WHAT WILL YOU ASK ME NEXT SCUSE ME
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0073 SAID THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD BUT COULD YOU KINDLY TELL ME WHAT HE HAS FOR DINNER
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0074 THEN THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE UNCOILED HIMSELF VERY QUICKLY FROM THE ROCK
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0075 AND SPANKED THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD WITH HIS SCALESOME FLAILSOME TAIL
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0076 THAT IS ODD SAID THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0077 BECAUSE MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER AND MY
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0078 UNCLE AND MY AUNT
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0079 NOT TO MENTION MY OTHER AUNT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AND MY OTHER UNCLE

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0081 AND I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE SAME THING
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0082 SO HE SAID GOOD BYE VERY POLITELY TO THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0083 AND HELPED TO COIL HIM UP ON THE ROCK AGAIN
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0084 AND WENT ON

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0089 ALL SET ABOUT WITH FEVER TREES BUT IT WAS REALLY THE CROCODILE

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0094 AND THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD STEPPED BACK MOST POLITELY
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0095 BECAUSE HE DID NOT WISH TO BE SPANKED AGAIN

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0132 THEN THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD SAT BACK ON HIS LITTLE HAUNCHES AND PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0133 AND HIS NOSE BEGAN TO STRETCH
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0134 AND THE CROCODILE FLOUNDERED INTO THE WATER MAKING IT ALL

kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0214 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS NEW TRUNK
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0215 THE REST OF THE TIME HE PICKED UP
kayray-20070611-ele/wav/ele0216 THE MELON RINDS THAT HE HAD DROPPED ON HIS WAY TO THE LIMPOPO

kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0005 HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS IN THE DAYS WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED FAIR
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0006 BEST BELOVED THE LEOPARD LIVED IN A PLACE CALLED
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0007 THE HIGH VELDT MEMBER IT WASN'T THE LOW VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0008 OR THE BUSH VELDT OR THE SOUR VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0009 BUT THE SCLUSIVELY BARE HOT SHINY HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0010 WHERE THERE WAS SAND AND SANDY COLOURED ROCK
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0011 AND SCLUSIVELY TUFTS OF SANDY YELLOWISH GRASS THE GIRAFFE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0012 AND THE ZEBRA AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO AND THE HARTEBEEST LIVED THERE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0013 AND THEY WERE SCLUSIVELY SANDY YELLOW BROWNISH ALL OVER BUT THE LEOPARD
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0014 HE WAS THE SCLUSIVEST SANDIEST YELLOWISH BROWNEST OF THEM ALL
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0015 A GREYISH YELLOWISH CATTY SHAPED KIND OF BEAST
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0016 AND HE MATCHED THE SCLUSIVELY YELLOWISH GREYISH BROWNISH COLOUR OF THE HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0017 TO ONE HAIR
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0018 THIS WAS VERY BAD FOR THE GIRAFFE AND THE ZEBRA AND THE REST OF THEM FOR HE WOULD LIE DOWN BY A SCLUSIVELY YELLOWISH GREYISH BROWNISH STONE OR CLUMP OF GRASS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0019 AND WHEN THE GIRAFFE OR THE ZEBRA OR THE ELAND OR THE KOODOO OR THE BUSH BUCK
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0020 OR THE BONTE BUCK CAME BY
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0021 HE WOULD SURPRISE THEM OUT OF THEIR JUMPSOME LIVES
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0022 HE WOULD INDEED AND ALSO THERE WAS AN ETHIOPIAN WITH BOWS AND ARROWS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0023 A SCLUSIVELY GREYISH BROWNISH YELLOWISH MAN HE WAS THEN
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0024 WHO LIVED ON THE HIGH VELDT WITH THE LEOPARD
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0025 AND THE TWO USED TO HUNT TOGETHER THE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0026 ETHIOPIAN WITH HIS BOWS AND ARROWS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0027 AND THE LEOPARD SCLUSIVELY WITH HIS TEETH AND CLAWS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0028 TILL THE GIRAFFE AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO AND THE QUAGGA
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0029 AND ALL THE REST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO JUMP
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0030 BEST BELOVED THEY DIDN'T INDEED AFTER A LONG TIME
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0031 THINGS LIVED FOR EVER SO LONG IN THOSE DAYS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0032 THEY LEARNED TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LEOPARD OR AN ETHIOPIAN
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0033 AND BIT BY BIT THE GIRAFFE BEGAN IT BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE THE LONGEST
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0034 THEY WENT AWAY FROM THE HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0035 THEY SCUTTLED FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND DAYS TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0036 SCLUSIVELY FULL OF TREES AND BUSHES AND STRIPY SPECKLY PATCHY BLATCHY SHADOWS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0037 AND THERE THEY HID
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0038 AND AFTER ANOTHER LONG TIME WHAT WITH STANDING HALF IN THE SHADE AND HALF OUT OF IT AND WHAT WITH
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0039 THE SLIPPERY SLIDY SHADOWS OF THE TREES FALLING ON THEM
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0040 THE GIRAFFE GREW BLOTCHY AND THE ZEBRA GREW STRIPY
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0041 AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO GREW DARKER WITH LITTLE WAVY GREY LINES ON THEIR BACKS LIKE BARK ON A TREE TRUNK
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0042 AND SO THOUGH YOU COULD HEAR THEM AND SMELL THEM
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0043 YOU COULD VERY SELDOM SEE THEM
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0044 AND THEN ONLY WHEN YOU KNEW PRECISELY WHERE TO LOOK
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0045 THEY HAD A BEAUTIFUL TIME
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0046 IN THE SCLUSIVELY SPECKLY SPICKLY SHADOWS OF THE FOREST WHILE THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN RAN ABOUT OVER THE SCLUSIVELY GREYISH YELLOWISH REDDISH HIGH VELDT OUTSIDE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0047 WONDERING WHERE ALL THEIR BREAKFASTS AND THEIR DINNERS AND THEIR TEAS HAD GONE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0048 AT LAST THEY WERE SO HUNGRY THAT THEY ATE RATS AND BEETLES AND ROCK RABBITS
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0049 THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN AND THEN THEY HAD THE BIG TUMMY ACHE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0050 BOTH TOGETHER AND THEN THEY MET BAVIAAN THE DOG HEADED BARKING BABOON
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0051 WHO IS QUITE THE WISEST ANIMAL IN ALL SOUTH AFRICA
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0052 SAID LEOPARD TO BAVIAAN AND IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY

kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0060 AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND THE ETHIOPIAN SAID
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0061 THAT IS ALL VERY FINE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0062 BUT I WISH TO KNOW WHITHER THE ABORIGINAL FAUNA HAS MIGRATED
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0063 THEN SAID BAVIAAN THE ABORIGINAL FAUNA HAS JOINED THE ABORIGINAL FLORA
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0064 BECAUSE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR A CHANGE
kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0065 AND MY ADVICE TO YOU ETHIOPIAN

kayray-20070611-leo/wav/leo0067 THAT PUZZLED THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN

kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
kc0vgj-20091223-qgw/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
KenBloom-20071112-ryd/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
KenBloom-20071122-ceg/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
KenBloom-20071122-fot/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
KenBloom-20071122-tid/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
KenBloom-20071122-xfp/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
KenMacRaild-20080702-xic/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
Keren-20080605-cps/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Keren-20080605-uzd/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE

khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
khemboy-20090128-lnk/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST

khemboy-20090129-gno/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
kmac_byc-20090415-xnt/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
kmac_byc-20090415-xnt/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES

kmaclean-20080111-mjp/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
kmaclean-20080111-mjp/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
kmaclean-20080111-mjp/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
kmaclean-20080111-mjp/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION

kmaclean-20080111-wjw/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
kmaclean-20080111-wjw/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
kmaclean-20080111-wjw/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
kmaclean-20080111-wjw/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
kmaclean-20080113-dgb/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
kmaclean-20080227-vty/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
kmaclean-20080403-gzi/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
kmaclean-20080403-gzi/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC

KnitGirl-20071113-dil/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
KnitGirl-20071113-dil/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED

KnitGirl-20071113-dil/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
KnitGirl-20071113-dil/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
KnitGirl-20071113-dil/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0005 HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE MOST OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0006 AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0007 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS THE WONDERFUL INCREASE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0008 BY THE APPLICATION OF MACHINERY THE IMPROVEMENT OF OLD TECHNICAL PROCESSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0009 AND THE INVENTION OF NEW ONES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVEN MORE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0010 OF OLD AND NEW MEANS OF LOCOMOTION AND INTERCOMMUNICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0011 BY THIS RAPID AND VAST MULTIPLICATION OF THE COMMODITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0012 AND CONVENIENCES OF EXISTENCE THE GENERAL STANDARD OF COMFORT HAS BEEN RAISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0013 THE RAVAGES OF PESTILENCE AND FAMINE HAVE BEEN CHECKED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0014 AND THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WHICH TIME AND SPACE OFFER TO MUTUAL INTERCOURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0015 HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN A MANNER AND TO AN EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0016 UNKNOWN TO FORMER AGES THE DIMINUTION OR REMOVAL OF LOCAL IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0017 THE CREATION OF COMMON INTERESTS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY SEPARATED PEOPLES AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0018 THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FORCES OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH AGAINST THOSE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0019 POLITICAL OR SOCIAL ANARCHY THUS EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0020 HAVE EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE PRESENT AND FUTURE FORTUNES OF MANKIND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0021 THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH MAY BE DIVINED BUT CANNOT AS YET
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0022 BE ESTIMATED AT ITS FULL VALUE THIS REVOLUTION FOR IT IS NOTHING LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0023 IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN CIVILISATION HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0024 BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIED AND IN GREAT MEASURE CAUSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0025 BY A LESS OBVIOUS BUT NO LESS MARVELLOUS INCREASE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0026 ESPECIALLY OF THAT PART OF IT WHICH IS KNOWN AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0027 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0028 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0029 NOT THAT THE GROWTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS AN EXCLUSIVE PREROGATIVE OF THE VICTORIAN AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0030 ITS PRESENT STRENGTH AND VOLUME MERELY INDICATE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF A STREAM
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0031 WHICH TOOK ITS RISE ALONGSIDE OF THE PRIMAL FOUNTS OF PHILOSOPHY LITERATURE AND ART
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0032 IN ANCIENT GREECE AND AFTER BEING DAMMED UP FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0033 ONCE MORE BEGAN TO FLOW THREE CENTURIES AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0034 IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF EVEN HANDED JUSTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0035 AS FREE FROM FULSOME PANEGYRIC AS FROM CAPTIOUS DEPRECIATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0036 HAS EVER YET BEEN DEALT OUT TO THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0037 WHO FOR EIGHT CENTURIES FROM THE TIME OF THALES TO THAT OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0038 TOILED AT THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0039 WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THAT LARGE QUESTION IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0040 IS CERTAIN THAT THE LABORS OF THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0041 WERE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL BY THE DECAY AND DISRUPTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0042 THE CONSEQUENT DISORGANISATION OF SOCIETY AND THE DIVERSION OF MEN'S THOUGHTS FROM SUBLUNARY MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0043 TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0044 SUGGESTED BY CHRISTIAN DOGMA IN THE MIDDLE AGES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0045 AND NOTWITHSTANDING SPORADIC ATTEMPTS TO RECALL MEN TO THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0046 HERE AND THERE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0047 THAT PHYSICAL SCIENCE MADE A NEW START FOUNDING ITSELF AT FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0048 ALTOGETHER UPON THAT WHICH HAD BEEN DONE BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0049 INDEED IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE MEN OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0050 RENAISSANCE THOUGH STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE OLD PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0051 WERE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY SAW AS MUCH AS THEIR FORERUNNERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0052 HAD DONE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CARRY FURTHER THE UNFINISHED WORK OF ARCHIMEDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0053 HIPPARCHUS AND PTOLEMY OF ARISTOTLE AND OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0054 NATURALLY ENOUGH AROSE AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICIANS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0055a FOR THE IMPERIOUS NECESSITY OF SEEKING SOME REMEDY FOR THE PHYSICAL ILLS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0055b HAD INSURED THE PRESERVATION OF MORE OR LESS OF THE WISDOM OF HIPPOCRATES AND HIS SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0056 AND BY A HAPPY CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0057 THE JEWISH AND THE ARABIAN PHYSICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0058 ESCAPED MANY OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH AT THAT TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0059 BLIGHTED NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0060 THE SUPERSTITIOUS HOPES AND FEARS WHICH AFFORDED COUNTENANCE TO ASTROLOGY AND TO ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0061 ALSO SHELTERED ASTRONOMY AND THE GERMS OF CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0062 WHETHER FOR THIS OR FOR SOME BETTER REASON THE FOUNDERS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE AGES INCLUDED ASTRONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0063 ALONG WITH GEOMETRY ARITHMETIC AND MUSIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0064 AS ONE OF THE FOUR BRANCHES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0065 AND IN THIS RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0066 IT IS ONLY JUST TO THEM TO OBSERVE THAT THEY WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THEIR SEATS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0067 THE SCHOOL MEN CONSIDERED NO ONE TO BE PROPERLY EDUCATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0068 UNLESS HE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH AT ANY RATE ONE BRANCH OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0069 PHYSICAL SCIENCE WE HAVE NOT EVEN YET REACHED THAT STAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0070 IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0071 THE MEN OF THE RENAISSANCE COULD SHOW THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT OUT TO GOOD INTEREST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0072 THE TREASURE BEQUEATHED TO THEM BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0073 THEY HAD PRODUCED THE ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEM OF COPERNICUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0074 WITH KEPLER'S GREAT ADDITIONS THE ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES AND THE PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0075 THE MECHANICS OF STEVINUS AND THE DE MAGNETE OF GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0076 THE ANATOMY OF THE GREAT FRENCH AND ITALIAN SCHOOLS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0077 AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HARVEY IN ITALY WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED GREECE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0078 IN THE HEGEMONY OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0079 THE ACCADEMIA DEI LYNCEI AND SUNDRY OTHER SUCH ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0080 THE MODELS OF ALL SUBSEQUENT ACADEMIES AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0081 HAD BEEN FOUNDED WHILE THE LITERARY SKILL AND BITING WIT OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0082 HAD MADE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0083 NOT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT ATTRACTIVE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0084 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FRANCIS BACON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0085 HAD ESSAYED TO SUM UP THE PAST OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0086 AND TO INDICATE THE PATH WHICH IT MUST FOLLOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0087 IF ITS GREAT DESTINIES WERE TO BE FULFILLED AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0088 THOUGH THE ATTEMPT WAS JUST SUCH A MAGNIFICENT FAILURE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF GREAT ENDOWMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0089 WHO WAS SO SINGULARLY DEVOID OF SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0090 THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE WORK ALREADY ACHIEVED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0091 BY THE TRUE INSTAURATORS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0092 YET THE MAJESTIC ELOQUENCE AND THE FERVID VATICINATIONS OF ONE WHO WAS CONSPICUOUS ALIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0093 BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS RISE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0094 AND THE DEPTH OF HIS FALL DREW THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0095 TO THE NEW BIRTH OF TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0096 BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO DISCOVER SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0097 THAT THE NOVUM ORGANUM HAD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0098 ANY DIRECT BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0099 NO DELUSION IS GREATER THAN THE NOTION THAT METHOD AND INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0100 CAN MAKE UP FOR LACK OF MOTHERWIT EITHER IN SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0101 OR IN PRACTICAL LIFE AND IT IS STRANGE THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0102 WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND BACON SHOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT HIS OR ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0103 VIA INVENIENDI SCIENTIAS WOULD LEVEL MEN'S WITS AND LEAVE LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0104 INBORN CAPACITY WHICH IS CALLED GENIUS AS A MATTER OF FACT BACON'S VIA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0105 HAS PROVED HOPELESSLY IMPRACTICABLE WHILE THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0106 BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES BASED ON INCOMPLETE INDUCTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0107 WHICH HE SPECIALLY CONDEMNS HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MOST EFFICIENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0108 INDEED AN INDISPENSABLE INSTRUMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FINALLY THAT TRANSCENDENTAL ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0109 THE SUPERINDUCEMENT OF NEW FORMS ON MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0110 WHICH BACON DECLARES TO BE THE SUPREME AIM OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0111 HAS BEEN WHOLLY IGNORED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0112 OF THE PRESENT DAY EVEN THE ELOQUENT ADVOCACY OF THE CHANCELLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0113 BROUGHT NO UNMIXED GOOD TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0114 IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT THE MAN WHO IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS TOOK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0115 ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS PATRIMONY BUT IN HIS WORSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0116 SOLD THAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR THE MESS OF POTTAGE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0117 COURT FAVOR AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS FOR POMP AND SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0118 SHOULD BE LED TO ATTACH AN UNDUE VALUE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0119 THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WHICH HE FORESAW AS ROGER BACON AND INDEED SENECA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0120 HAD FORESEEN LONG BEFORE HIS TIME MUST FOLLOW IN THE TRAIN OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0121a THE BURDEN OF BACON'S PLEADINGS FOR SCIENCE IS THE GATHERING OF FRUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0121b THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING SOLID MATERIAL ADVANTAGES BY THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0122 AND THE DESIRABLENESS OF LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0123 OF INQUIRY TO THAT FIELD BACON'S YOUNGER CONTEMPORARY HOBBES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0124 CASTING ASIDE THE PRUDENT RESERVE OF HIS PREDECESSOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0125 IN REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0126 ABOUT WHICH THE CROWN OR THE CHURCH MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF INQUIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0127 TO THE PHENOMENA OF MIND AND THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0128 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE INDICATED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PROVINCE OF REAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0129 AND THAT OF IMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LEVIATHAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0130 EMBODY A COHERENT SYSTEM OF PURELY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0131 IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS A MODEL OF CLEAR AND VIGOROUS ENGLISH STYLE AT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0132 THE SAME TIME IN FRANCE A MAN OF FAR GREATER SCIENTIFIC CAPACITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0133 THAN EITHER BACON OR HOBBES RENE DESCARTES NOT ONLY IN HIS IMMORTAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0134 DISCOURS DE LA METHODE AND ELSEWHERE WENT DOWN TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0135 BUT IN HIS PRINCIPES DE PHILOSOPHIE INDICATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0136 WHERE THE GOAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE REALLY LAY HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0137 DESCARTES WAS AN EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BENT OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0138 HIS MIND LED HIM TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING FROM GENERAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0139 AS MUCH AS BACON HAD UNDERESTIMATED IT THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0140 HAS BEEN EFFECTED NEITHER BY BACONIANS NOR BY CARTESIANS AS SUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0141 BUT BY MEN LIKE GALILEO AND HARVEY BOYLE AND NEWTON WHO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0142 WOULD HAVE DONE THEIR WORK JUST AS WELL IF NEITHER BACON NOR DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0143 HAD EVER PROPOUNDED THEIR VIEWS RESPECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0144 SHOULD BE PURSUED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0145a THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AFTER BACON'S DEATH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0145b BY MEANS VERIFIED HIS SANGUINE PREDICTION OF THE FRUITS WHICH IT WOULD YIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0146 FOR THOUGH THE REVIVED AND RENEWED STUDY OF NATURE HAD SPREAD AND GROWN TO AN EXTENT WHICH SURPASSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0147 REASONABLE EXPECTATION THE PRACTICAL RESULTS THE GOOD TO MEN'S ESTATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0148 WERE AT FIRST BY NO MEANS APPARENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0149a SIXTY YEARS AFTER BACON'S DEATH NEWTON HAD CROWNED THE LONG LABORS OF THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0149b BY COORDINATING THE PHENOMENA OF SOLAR MOTION THROUGHOUT THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0150 INTO ONE VAST SYSTEM BUT THE PRINCIPIA HELPED NO MAN TO EITHER WEALTH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0151 OR COMFORT DESCARTES NEWTON AND LEIBNITZ
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0152 HAD OPENED UP NEW WORLDS TO THE MATHEMATICIAN BUT THE ACQUISITIONS OF THEIR GENIUS ENRICHED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0153 ONLY MAN'S IDEAL ESTATE DESCARTES HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF RATIONAL COSMOGONY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0154 AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY BOYLE HAD PRODUCED MODELS OF EXPERIMENTATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0155 IN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PASCAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0156 AND TORRICELLI HAD WEIGHED THE AIR MALPIGHI AND GREW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0157 RAY AND WILLOUGHBY HAD DONE WORK OF NO LESS IMPORTANCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0158 BUT WEAVING AND SPINNING WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE OLD APPLIANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0159 NOBODY COULD TRAVEL FASTER BY SEA OR BY LAND THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0160 AND KING GEORGE COULD SEND A MESSAGE FROM LONDON TO YORK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0161 NO FASTER THAN KING JOHN MIGHT HAVE DONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0162 METALS WERE WORKED FROM THEIR ORES BY IMMEMORIAL RULE OF THUMB
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0163 AND THE CENTRE OF THE IRON TRADE OF THESE ISLANDS WAS STILL AMONG THE OAK FORESTS OF SUSSEX
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0164 THE UTMOST SKILL OF OUR MECHANICIANS DID NOT GET BEYOND THE PRODUCTION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0165 A COARSE WATCH THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS ILLUSTRATED BY A
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0166 HOST OF GREAT NAMES IN SCIENCE ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND ITALIAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0167 ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF CHEMISTRY GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0168 BUT THIS DEEPENING AND BROADENING OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED NEXT TO NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0169 EVEN IF AT THIS TIME FRANCIS BACON COULD HAVE RETURNED TO THE SCENE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0170 OF HIS GREATNESS AND OF HIS LITTLENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0171 HE MUST HAVE REGARDED THE PHILOSOPHIC WORLD WHICH PRAISED AND DISREGARDED HIS PRECEPTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0172 WITH GREAT DISFAVOR IF GHOSTS ARE CONSISTENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0173 THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL WASTING THEIR TIME JUST AS GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0174 AND KEPLER AND GALILEO AND MY WORTHY PHYSICIAN HARVEY DID IN MY DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0175 WHERE ARE THE FRUITS OF THE RESTORATION OF SCIENCE WHICH I PROMISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0176 THIS ACCUMULATION OF BARE KNOWLEDGE IS ALL VERY WELL BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0177 CUI BONO NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IS DOING WHAT I TOLD HIM SPECIALLY TO DO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0178 AND SEEKING THAT SECRET OF THE CAUSE OF FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0179 WHICH WILL ENABLE MEN TO DEAL AT WILL WITH MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0180 AND SUPERINDUCE NEW NATURES UPON THE OLD FOUNDATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0181 BUT A LITTLE LATER THAT GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE BEYOND IMAGINABLE UTILITARIAN ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0182 WHICH IS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT OF ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0183 BEGAN TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0184 UPON PRACTICAL LIFE AND THE OPERATION OF THAT PART OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0185 WE CALL HUMAN UPON THE REST BEGAN TO CREATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0186 NOT NEW NATURES IN BACON'S SENSE BUT A NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0187 THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH IS DEPENDENT UPON MEN'S EFFORTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0188 WHICH IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEIR WANTS AND WHICH WOULD DISAPPEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0189 IF MAN'S SHAPING AND GUIDING HAND WERE WITHDRAWN EVERY MECHANICAL ARTIFICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0190 EVERY CHEMICALLY PURE SUBSTANCE EMPLOYED IN MANUFACTURE EVERY ABNORMALLY FERTILE RACE OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0191 OR RAPIDLY GROWING AND FATTENING BREED OF ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0192 IS A PART OF THE NEW NATURE CREATED BY SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0193 WITHOUT IT THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS OF MODERN EUROPE AND AMERICA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0194 MUST RETAIN THEIR PRIMITIVE SPARSELY INHABITED AGRICULTURAL OR PASTORAL CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0195 IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WEALTH AND THE CONDITION OF OUR SAFETY FROM SUBMERGENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0196 BY ANOTHER FLOOD OF BARBAROUS HORDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0197 IT IS THE BOND WHICH UNITES INTO A SOLID POLITICAL WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0198 REGIONS LARGER THAN ANY EMPIRE OF ANTIQUITY IT SECURES US FROM THE RECURRENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0199 OF THE PESTILENCES AND FAMINES OF FORMER TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0200 IT IS THE SOURCE OF ENDLESS COMFORTS AND CONVENIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0201 WHICH ARE NOT MERE LUXURIES BUT CONDUCE TO PHYSICAL AND MORAL WELL BEING
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0202 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THIS NEW BIRTH OF TIME THIS NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0203 BEGOTTEN BY SCIENCE UPON FACT HAS PRESSED ITSELF DAILY AND HOURLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0204 UPON OUR ATTENTION AND HAS WORKED MIRACLES WHICH HAVE MODIFIED THE WHOLE FASHION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0205 OF OUR LIVES WHAT WONDER THEN IF THESE ASTONISHING FRUITS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0206 ARE TOO OFTEN REGARDED BY BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0207 AS THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0208 WHAT WONDER IF SOME EULOGISE AND OTHERS REVILE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0209 THE NEW PHILOSOPHY FOR ITS UTILITARIAN ENDS AND ITS MERELY MATERIAL TRIUMPHS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0210 IN TRUTH THE NEW PHILOSOPHY DESERVES NEITHER THE PRAISE OF ITS EULOGISTS NOR THE BLAME OF ITS SLANDERERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0211 AS I HAVE POINTED OUT ITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0212 DISCIPLES WERE GUIDED BY NO SEARCH AFTER PRACTICAL FRUITS DURING THE GREAT PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH AND IT REACHED ADOLESCENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0213 WITHOUT BEING STIMULATED BY ANY REWARDS OF THAT NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0214 THE BARE ENUMERATION OF THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0215 WERE THE GREAT LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0216 EIGHTEENTH AND THE FIRST DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OF HERSCHEL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0217 OF LAPLACE OF YOUNG OF FRESNEL OF OERSTED OF CAVENDISH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0218 OF LAVOISIER OF DAVY OF LAMARCK OF CUVIER OF JUSSIEU
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0219 OF DECANDOLLE OF WERNER AND OF HUTTON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0220 SUFFICES TO INDICATE THE STRENGTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE AGE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THAT OF WHICH I HAVE TO TREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0221 BUT OF WHICH OF THESE GREAT MEN CAN IT BE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0222 THAT THEIR LABORS WERE DIRECTED TO PRACTICAL ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0223 I DO NOT CALL TO MIND EVEN AN INVENTION OF PRACTICAL UTILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0224 WHICH WE OWE TO ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE SAFETY LAMP OF DAVY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0225 WERNER CERTAINLY PAID ATTENTION TO MINING AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN JAMES WATT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0226 BUT THOUGH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0227 BY WHICH WATT CONVERTED THE STEAM ENGINE INVENTED LONG BEFORE HIS TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0228 INTO THE OBEDIENT SLAVE OF MAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0229 WERE SUGGESTED AND GUIDED BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0230 HIS SKILL AS A PRACTICAL MECHANICIAN AND THE EFFICIENCY OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci/wav/sci0231 BOLTON'S WORKMEN HAD QUITE AS MUCH TO DO WITH THE REALISATION OF HIS PROJECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0001 IN FACT THE HISTORY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE TEACHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0002 AND WE CANNOT TOO CAREFULLY TAKE THE LESSON TO HEART
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0003 THAT THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES ATTAINABLE THROUGH ITS AGENCY NEVER HAVE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0004 BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0005 TO MEN INSPIRED BY THE INBORN GENIUS OF THE INTERPRETER OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0006 TO GIVE THEM COURAGE TO UNDERGO THE TOILS AND MAKE THE SACRIFICES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0007 WHICH THAT CALLING REQUIRES FROM ITS VOTARIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0008 THAT WHICH STIRS THEIR PULSES IS THE LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0009 AND THE JOY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSES OF THINGS SUNG BY THE OLD POETS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0010 THE SUPREME DELIGHT OF EXTENDING THE REALM OF LAW AND ORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0011 EVER FARTHER TOWARDS THE UNATTAINABLE GOALS OF THE INFINITELY GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0012 AND THE INFINITELY SMALL BETWEEN WHICH OUR LITTLE RACE OF LIFE IS RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0013 IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK THE PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHER SOMETIMES INTENTIONALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0014 MUCH MORE OFTEN UNINTENTIONALLY LIGHTS UPON SOMETHING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0015 WHICH PROVES TO BE OF PRACTICAL VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0016 GREAT IS THE REJOICING OF THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITED THEREBY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0017 AND FOR THE MOMENT SCIENCE IS THE DIANA OF ALL THE CRAFTSMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0018 BUT EVEN WHILE THE CRIES OF JUBILATION RESOUND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0019 AND THIS FLOATSAM AND JETSAM OF THE TIDE OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0020 IS BEING TURNED INTO THE WAGES OF WORKMEN AND THE WEALTH OF CAPITALISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0021 THE CREST OF THE WAVE OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0022 IS FAR AWAY ON ITS COURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0023a OVER THE ILLIMITABLE OCEAN OF THE UNKNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0023b FAR BE IT FROM ME TO DEPRECIATE THE VALUE OF THE GIFTS OF SCIENCE TO PRACTICAL LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0024 OR TO CAST A DOUBT UPON THE PROPRIETY OF THE COURSE OF ACTION OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0025 IN THE HOPE OF FINDING WEALTH ALONGSIDE TRUTH OR EVEN WEALTH ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0026 SUCH A PROFESSION IS AS RESPECTABLE AS ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0027 AND QUITE AS LITTLE DO I DESIRE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0028 IF INDUSTRY OWES A HEAVY DEBT TO SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0029 IT HAS LARGELY REPAID THE LOAN BY THE IMPORTANT AID WHICH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0030 HAS IN ITS TURN RENDERED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0031 IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSES WHICH HINDERED THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE SCHOOLS OF ATHENS AND OF ALEXANDRIA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0032 IT HAS OFTEN STRUCK ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0033 THAT WHERE THE GREEKS DID WONDERS WAS IN JUST THOSE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0034 SUCH AS GEOMETRY ASTRONOMY AND ANATOMY WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF VERY CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0035 WITHOUT ANY OR ANY BUT THE SIMPLEST APPLIANCES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0036 IS A CURIOUS SPECULATION TO THINK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0037 WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0038 IF GLASS AND ALCOHOL HAD NOT BEEN EASILY OBTAINABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0039 AND IF THE GRADUAL PERFECTION OF MECHANICAL SKILL FOR INDUSTRIAL ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0040 HAD NOT ENABLED INVESTIGATORS TO OBTAIN AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE COST
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0041 MICROSCOPES TELESCOPES AND ALL THE EXQUISITELY DELICATE APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0042 FOR DETERMINING WEIGHT AND MEASURE AND FOR ESTIMATING THE LAPSE OF TIME WITH EXACTNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0043 WHICH THEY NOW COMMAND IF SCIENCE HAS RENDERED THE COLOSSAL DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INDUSTRY POSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0044 BEYOND A DOUBT INDUSTRY HAS DONE NO LESS FOR MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0045 AND FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MODERN BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0046 AND AS THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY HAVE AT LAST
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0047 BEGUN TO BE AWARE THAT THE CONDITION OF SUCCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0048 IN THAT WARFARE UNDER THE TERMS OF PEACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0049 WHICH IS KNOWN AS INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION LIES IN THE DISCIPLINE OF THE TROOPS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0050 AND THE USE OF ARMS OF PRECISION JUST AS MUCH AS IT DOES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0051 IN THE WARFARE WHICH IS CALLED WAR THEIR DEMAND FOR THAT DISCIPLINE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0052 WHICH IS TECHNICAL EDUCATION IS REACTING UPON SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0053 IN A MANNER WHICH WILL ASSUREDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0054 STIMULATE ITS FUTURE GROWTH TO AN INCALCULABLE EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0055 IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS THAT THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0056 AND OF INDUSTRY ARE IDENTICAL THAT SCIENCE CANNOT MAKE A STEP FORWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0057 WITHOUT SOONER OR LATER OPENING UP NEW CHANNELS FOR INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0058 AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT EVERY ADVANCE OF INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0059 FACILITATES THOSE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS UPON WHICH THE GROWTH OF SCIENCE DEPENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0060 WE MAY HOPE THAT AT LAST THE WEARY MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PRACTICAL MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0061 WHO PROFESSED TO DESPISE SCIENCE AND THE HIGH AND DRY PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0062 WHO PROFESSED TO DESPISE PRACTICAL RESULTS IS AT AN END
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0063 NEVERTHELESS THAT WHICH IS TRUE OF THE INFANCY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE GREEK WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0064 THAT WHICH IS TRUE OF ITS ADOLESCENCE IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0065 REMAINS TRUE OF ITS RIPER AGE IN THESE LATTER DAYS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0066 THE GREAT STEPS IN ITS PROGRESS HAVE BEEN MADE ARE MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0067 AND WILL BE MADE BY MEN WHO SEEK KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0068 SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CRAVE FOR IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0069 THEY HAVE THEIR WEAKNESSES THEIR FOLLIES THEIR VANITIES AND THEIR RIVALRIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0070 LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0071 BUT WHATEVER BY ENDS MAY MAR THEIR DIGNITY AND IMPEDE THEIR USEFULNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0072 THIS CHIEF END REDEEMS THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0073 FRESNEL AFTER A BRILLIANT CAREER OF DISCOVERY IN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT REGIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0074 OF PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE DIED AT THIRTY NINE YEARS OF AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0075 THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF A LETTER FROM HIM TO YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0076 WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR QUOTED BY WHEWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0077 SO APTLY ILLUSTRATES THE SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATES THE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0078 THAT I MAY CITE IT FOR A LONG TIME THAT SENSIBILITY OR THAT VANITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0079 WHICH PEOPLE CALL LOVE OF GLORY IS MUNCH BLUNTED IN ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0080 I LABOR MUCH LESS TO CATCH THE SUFFRAGES OF THE PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0081 THAN TO OBTAIN AN INWARD APPROVAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0082 WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MENTAL REWARD OF MY EFFORTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0083 WITHOUT DOUBT I HAVE OFTEN WANTED THE SPUR OF VANITY TO EXCITE ME TO PURSUE MY RESEARCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0084 IN MOMENTS OF DISGUST AND DISCOURAGEMENT BUT ALL THE COMPLIMENTS WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0085 FROM M M ARAGO DE LAPLACE OR BIOT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0086 NEVER GAVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0087 AS THE DISCOVERY OF A THEORETICAL TRUTH OR THE CONFIRMATION OF A CALCULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0088 BY EXPERIMENT NOTHING GREAT IN SCIENCE HAS EVER BEEN DONE BY MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0089 WHATEVER THEIR POWERS IN WHOM THE DIVINE AFFLATUS OF THE TRUTH SEEKER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0090 WAS WANTING MEN OF MODERATE CAPACITY HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS BECAUSE IT ANIMATED THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0091 AND MEN OF GREAT NATURAL GIFTS HAVE FAILED ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0092 BECAUSE THEY LACKED THIS ONE THING NEEDFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0093 TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE BUSINESS OF INVESTIGATION PRACTICALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0094 BACON'S NOTION OF ESTABLISHING A COMPANY OF INVESTIGATORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0095 TO WORK FOR FRUITS AS IF THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0096 WERE A KIND OF MINING OPERATION AND ONLY REQUIRED WELL DIRECTED PICKS AND SHOVELS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0097 SEEMS VERY STRANGE IN SCIENCE AS IN ART
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0098 AND AS I BELIEVE IN EVERY OTHER SPHERE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0099 THERE MAY BE WISDOM IN A MULTITUDE OF COUNSELLORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0100 BUT IT IS ONLY IN ONE OR TWO OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0101 AND IN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY AT ANY RATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0102 IT IS TO THAT ONE OR TWO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0103 THAT WE MUST LOOK FOR LIGHT AND GUIDANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0104 NEWTON SAID THAT HE MADE HIS DISCOVERIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0105 BY INTENDING HIS MIND ON THE SUBJECT NO DOUBT TRULY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0106 BUT TO EQUAL HIS SUCCESS ONE MUST HAVE THE MIND WHICH HE INTENDED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0107 FORTY LESSER MEN MIGHT HAVE INTENDED THEIR MINDS TILL THEY CRACKED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0108 WITHOUT ANY LIKE RESULT IT WOULD BE IDLE EITHER TO AFFIRM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0109 OR TO DENY THAT THE LAST HALF CENTURY HAS PRODUCED MEN OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0110 OF THE CALIBRE OF NEWTON
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0111 IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT IT CAN SHOW A FEW CAPACITIES OF THE FIRST RANK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0112 COMPETENT NOT ONLY TO DEAL PROFITABLY WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0113 THE INHERITANCE BEQUEATHED BY THEIR SCIENTIFIC FOREFATHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0114 BUT TO PASS ON TO THEIR SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0115 PHYSICAL TRUTHS OF A HIGHER ORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0116 THAN ANY YET REACHED BY THE HUMAN RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0117 AND IF THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED AS NEWTON SUCCEEDED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0118 IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOUGHT TRUTH AS HE SOUGHT IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0119 WITH NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE FINDING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0120 I AM CONSCIOUS THAT IN UNDERTAKING TO GIVE EVEN THE BRIEFEST SKETCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0121 OF THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN ALL ITS BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0122 DURING THE LAST HALF CENTURY I MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE EXHIBITED MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0123 COURAGE THAN DISCRETION AND PERHAPS MORE PRESUMPTION THAN EITHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0124 SO FAR AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS CONCERNED THE DAYS OF ADMIRABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0125 CRICHTONS HAVE LONG BEEN OVER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0126 AND THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE OF HARD WORKERS MAY THINK HE HAS DONE WELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0127 IF HE HAS MASTERED ONE OF ITS MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0128 NEVERTHELESS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0129 WHO HAS FAMILIARISED HIMSELF WITH THE OPERATIONS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0130 IN ONE DEPARTMENT TO COMPREHEND THE SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0131 AND EVEN TO FORM A GENERAL ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0132 THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SPECIALISTS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS NOR IS THEIR ANY LACK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0133 EITHER OF GUIDANCE OR OF AIDS TO IGNORANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0134 BY A HAPPY CHANCE THE FIRST EDITION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0135 WHEWELL'S HISTORY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0136 IT AFFORDS A VERY USEFUL VIEW OF THE STATE OF THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0137 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICTORIAN EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0138 AS TO SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXCELLENT SUMMARIES OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0139 THE PROGRESS OF VARIOUS BRANCHES OF SCIENCE ESPECIALLY UP TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0140 WHICH WAS THE JUBILEE YEAR OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0141 AND WITH RESPECT TO THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0142 WITH SOME PARTS OF WHICH MY STUDIES HAVE FAMILIARISED ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0143 MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NEARLY COINCIDES WITH THE PRECEDING HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0144 I MAY HOPE THEREFORE THAT MY CHANCE OF ESCAPING SERIOUS ERRORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0145 IS AS GOOD AS THAT OF ANYONE ELSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0146 WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO UNDERTAKE THE SOMEWHAT PERILOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0147 ENTERPRISE IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF ENGAGED THERE IS YET ANOTHER PREFATORY REMARK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0148 WHICH IT SEEMS DESIRABLE I SHOULD MAKE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0149 IT IS THAT I THINK IT PROPER TO CONFINE MYSELF TO THE WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0150 DONE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE DOERS OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0151 MEDDLING WITH QUESTIONS OF MERIT AND PRIORITY IS A THORNY BUSINESS AT THE BEST OF TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0152 AND UNLESS IN CASE OF NECESSITY ALTOGETHER UNDESIRABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0153 WHEN ONE IS DEALING WITH CONTEMPORARIES NO SUCH NECESSITY LIES UPON ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0154 AND I SHALL THEREFORE MENTION NO NAMES OF LIVING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0155 LEST PERCHANCE I SHOULD INCUR THE REPROOF WHICH THE ISRAELITES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0156 WHO STRUGGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE FIELD ADDRESSED TO MOSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0157 WHO MADE THEE A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0158 PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS ONE AND INDIVISIBLE ALTHOUGH FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES IT IS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0159 CONVENIENT TO MARK IT OUT INTO THE PRIMARY REGIONS OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0160 CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND TO SUBDIVIDE THESE INTO SUBORDINATE PROVINCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0161 YET THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION AND THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF THE PHYSICAL INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0162 ARE EVERYWHERE THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0163 THE OBJECT IS THE DISCOVERY OF THE RATIONAL ORDER WHICH PERVADES THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0164 THE METHOD CONSISTS OF OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0165 WHICH IS OBSERVATION UNDER ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0166 THE DETERMINATION OF THE FACTS OF NATURE OF INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0167 FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS AND CONNECTION THE VARIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0168 BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DIFFER IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT OF THEIR HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0169 OBSERVATION ON THE ONE HAND OR RATIOCINATION ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0170 IS THEIR MORE OBVIOUS FEATURE BUT IN NO OTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0171 AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE INCORRECT THAN THE ASSUMPTION ONE SOMETIMES MEETS WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0172 THAT PHYSICS HAS ONE METHOD CHEMISTRY ANOTHER AND BIOLOGY A THIRD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0173 ALL PHYSICAL SCIENCE STARTS FROM CERTAIN POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0174 ONE OF THEM IS THE OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE OF A MATERIAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0175 IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE PHENOMENA WHICH ARE COMPREHENDED UNDER THIS NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0176 HAVE A SUBSTRATUM OF EXTENDED IMPENETRABLE MOBILE SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0177 WHICH EXHIBITS THE QUALITY KNOWN AS INERTIA AND IS TERMED MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0178 I AM AWARE THAT THIS PROPOSITION MAY BE CHALLENGED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0179 IT MAY BE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF BOSCOVICH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0180 MATTER HAS NO EXTENSION BEING REDUCED TO MATHEMATICAL POINTS SERVING AS CENTRES OF FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0181 BUT AS THE FORCES OF THE VARIOUS CENTRES ARE CONCEIVED TO LIMIT ONE ANOTHER'S ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0182 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT AN AREA AROUND EACH CENTRE HAS AN INDIVIDUALITY OF ITS OWN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0183 EXTENSION COMES BACK IN THE FORM OF THAT AREA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0184 AGAIN A VERY EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST THE LATE CLERK MAXWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0185 HAS DECLARED THAT IMPENETRABILITY IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO OUR NOTIONS OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0186 AND THAT TWO ATOMS MAY CONCEIVABLY OCCUPY THE SAME SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0187 I AM LOTH TO DISPUTE ANY DICTUM OF A PHILOSOPHER AS REMARKABLE FOR THE SUBTLETY OF HIS INTELLECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0188 AS FOR HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE BUT THE ASSERTION THAT ONE AND THE SAME POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0189 OR AREA OF SPACE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEIVABLY OPPOSITE ATTRIBUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0190 APPEARS TO ME TO VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRADICTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0191 WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION NOT ONLY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0192 BUT OF LOGIC IN GENERAL IT MEANS THAT A
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0193 CAN NOT BE NOT A ANOTHER POSTULATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0194 IS THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE LAW OF CAUSATION THAT NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT A CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0195 THAT IS A NECESSARY PRECEDENT CONDITION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0196 THAT THE STATE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0197 IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ITS STATE AT ANY PRECEDING MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0198 ANOTHER IS THAT ANY OF THE RULES OR SO CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0199 LAWS OF NATURE BY WHICH THE RELATION OF PHENOMENA IS TRULY DEFINED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0200 IS TRUE FOR ALL TIME THE VALIDITY OF THESE POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0201 IS A PROBLEM OF METAPHYSICS THEY ARE NEITHER SELF EVIDENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0202 NOR ARE THEY STRICTLY SPEAKING DEMONSTRABLE THE JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0203 AS AXIOMS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0204 LIES IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT EXPECTATIONS LOGICALLY BASED UPON THEM ARE VERIFIED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0205 OR AT ANY RATE NOT CONTRADICTED WHENEVER THEY CAN BE TESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0206 BY EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL SCIENCE THEREFORE RESTS ON VERIFIED OR UNCONTRADICTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0207 HYPOTHESES AND SUCH BEING THE CASE IT IS NOT SURPRISING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0208 THAT A GREAT CONDITION OF ITS PROGRESS HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0209 BEEN THE INVENTION OF VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0210 IT IS A FAVORITE POPULAR DELUSION THAT THE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0211 IS UNDER A SORT OF MORAL OBLIGATION TO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0212 ABSTAIN FROM GOING BEYOND THAT GENERALISATION OF OBSERVED FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0213 WHICH IS ABSURDLY CALLED BACONIAN INDUCTION BUT ANYONE WHO IS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0214 PRACTICALLY ACQUAINTED WITH SCIENTIFIC WORK IS AWARE THAT THOSE WHO REFUSE TO GO BEYOND FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0215 RARELY GET AS FAR AS FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0216 AND ANYONE WHO HAS STUDIED THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE KNOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0217 THAT ALMOST EVERY GREAT STEP THEREIN HAS BEEN MADE BY THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0218 THAT IS BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES WHICH THOUGH VERIFIABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0219 OFTEN HAD VERY LITTLE FOUNDATION TO START WITH AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0220 NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN SPITE OF A LONG CAREER OF USEFULNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0221 TURNED OUT TO BE WHOLLY ERRONEOUS IN THE LONG RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0222 THE GEOCENTRIC SYSTEM OF ASTRONOMY WITH ITS ECCENTRICS AND ITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0223 EPICYCLES WAS AN HYPOTHESIS UTTERLY AT VARIANCE WITH FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0224 WHICH NEVERTHELESS DID GREAT THINGS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0225 KEPLER WAS THE WILDEST OF GUESSERS NEWTON'S CORPUSCULAR THEORY OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0226 WAS OF MUCH TEMPORARY USE IN OPTICS THOUGH NOBODY NOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0227 BELIEVES IN IT AND THE UNDULATORY THEORY WHICH HAS SUPERSEDED THE CORPUSCULAR THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0228 AND HAS PROVED ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE OF INSTRUMENTS OF RESEARCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0229 IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0230 THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH ARE DEFINED IN PROPOSITIONS SOME OF WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0231 TO ORDINARY APPREHENSION SEEM PHYSICAL ANTINOMIES IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL TO SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0232 THAT THE ATTAINMENT OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH HAS BEEN EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0233 TO A GREAT EXTENT BY THE HELP OF SCIENTIFIC ERRORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0234 BUT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS FURNISHED BY OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0235 WHICH CANNOT EXTEND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF OUR FACULTIES WHILE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0236 EVEN WITHIN THOSE LIMITS WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY OBSERVATION IS ABSOLUTELY EXACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0237 AND EXHAUSTIVE HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY GIVEN GENERALISATION FROM OBSERVATION MAY BE TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0238 WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION AT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0239 A GIVEN TIME AND YET TURN OUT TO BE UNTRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0240 WHEN THOSE POWERS OF OBSERVATION ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ENLARGED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0241 OR TO PUT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0242 A DOCTRINE WHICH IS UNTRUE ABSOLUTELY MAY TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0243 BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF AN INTERPRETATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0244 THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PLANETS MOVE IN CIRCLES WAS TRUE ENOUGH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0245 TO SERVE THE PURPOSE OF CORRELATING SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS WERE THEN POSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0246 AFTER KEPLER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY MOVE IN ELLIPSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0247 BECAME TRUE ENOUGH IN REGARD TO THE STATE OF OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0248 AT THAT TIME WE SAY STILL THAT THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS ARE ELLIPSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0249 BECAUSE FOR ALL ORDINARY PURPOSES THAT IS A SUFFICIENTLY NEAR APPROXIMATION TO THE TRUTH BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0250 THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF A PLANET DESCRIBES NEITHER AN ELLIPSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0251 OR ANY OTHER SIMPLE CURVE BUT AN IMMENSELY COMPLICATED UNDULATING LINE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0252 IT MAY FAIRLY BE DOUBTED WHETHER ANY GENERALISATION OR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0253 BASED UPON PHYSICAL DATA IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0254 THE SENSE THAT A MATHEMATICAL PROPOSITION IS SO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0255 BUT IF ITS ERRORS CAN BECOME APPARENT ONLY OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0256 PRACTICABLE OBSERVATION IT MAY BE JUST AS USEFULLY ADOPTED FOR ONE OF THE SYMBOLS OF THAT ALGEBRA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0257 BY WHICH WE INTERPRET NATURE AS IF IT WERE ABSOLUTELY TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0258 END OF SECTION ONE THIS HAS BEEN A LIBRIVOX RECORDING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci/wav/sci0259 ALL LIBRIVOX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0001 SECTION TWO OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY BRANCH OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE PRESENTS THREE STAGES WHICH IN THEIR LOGICAL RELATION ARE SUCCESSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0003 THE FIRST IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SENSIBLE CHARACTER AND ORDER OF THE PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0004 THIS IS NATURAL HISTORY IN THE ORIGINAL SENSE OF THE TERM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0005 AND HERE NOTHING BUT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT AVAIL US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0006 THE SECOND IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT RELATIONS OF THE PHENOMENA THUS DEFINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0007 AND THEIR EXPRESSION IN RULES OR LAWS THE THIRD IS THE EXPLICATION OF THESE PARTICULAR LAWS BY DEDUCTION FROM THE MOST GENERAL LAWS OF MATTER AND MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0008 THE LAST TWO STAGES CONSTITUTE NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN ITS ORIGINAL SENSE IN THIS REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0009 THE INVENTION OF VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES IS NOT ONLY PERMISSIBLE BUT IS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF PROGRESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0010 HISTORICALLY NO BRANCH OF SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED THIS ORDER OF GROWTH BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0011 FROM THE DAWN OF EXACT KNOWLEDGE TO THE PRESENT DAY OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT AND SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0012 HAVE GONE HAND IN HAND AND WHENEVER SCIENCE HAS HALTED OR STRAYED FROM THE RIGHT PATH IT HAS BEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0013 EITHER BECAUSE ITS VOTARIES HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH MERE UNVERIFIED OR UNVERIFIABLE SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0014 AND THIS IS THE COMMONEST CASE BECAUSE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT ARE HARD WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0015 WHILE SPECULATION IS AMUSING OR IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE ACCUMULATION OF DETAILS OF OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0016 HAS FOR A TIME EXCLUDED SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0017 THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE SINCE THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT MEN HAVE GRADUALLY LEARNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0018 TO LAY ASIDE THE CONSIDERATION OF UNVERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES TO GUIDE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT BY VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0019 AND TO CONSIDER THE LATTER NOT AS IDEAL TRUTHS THE REAL ENTITIES OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD BEHIND PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0020 BUT AS A SYMBOLICAL LANGUAGE BY THE AID OF WHICH NATURE CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0021 APPREHENSIBLE BY OUR INTELLECTS AND IF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0022 ATTAINED DIMENSIONS BEYOND ALL FORMER PRECEDENT AND CAN EXHIBIT ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN ANY FORMER SUCH PERIOD CAN SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0023 IT IS BECAUSE ABLE MEN ANIMATED BY THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT CAREFULLY TRAINED IN THE METHOD OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0024 AND HAVING AT THEIR DISPOSAL IMMENSELY IMPROVED APPLIANCES HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE BOUNDARIES OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0025 IN GREATER NUMBER THAN DURING ANY PREVIOUS HALF CENTURY OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0026 I HAVE SAID THAT OUR EPOCH CAN PRODUCE ACHIEVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE OF GREATER MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0027 THAN ANY OTHER HAS TO SHOW ADVISEDLY AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE THREE GREAT PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME WHICH JUSTIFY THE ASSERTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0028 ONE OF THESE IS THAT DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER WHICH FOR WANT OF A BETTER NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0029 I WILL CALL MOLECULAR THE SECOND IS THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0030 THE THIRD IS THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION EACH OF THESE WAS FORESHADOWED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0031 MORE OR LESS DISTINCTLY IN FORMER PERIODS OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0032 AND SO FAR IS EITHER FROM BEING THE OUTCOME OF PURELY INDUCTIVE REASONING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0033 THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF METAPHYSICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0034 AND EVEN OF THEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THREE THE PECULIAR MERIT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0035 IS THAT IT HAS SHOWN HOW THESE HYPOTHESES CONNECT A VAST NUMBER OF SEEMINGLY INDEPENDENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0036 PARTIAL GENERALISATIONS THAT IT HAS GIVEN THEM THAT PRECISION OF EXPRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0037 WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THEIR EXACT VERIFICATION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0038 THAT IT HAS PRACTICALLY PROVED THEIR VALUE AS GUIDES TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TRUTH ALL THREE DOCTRINES ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0039 AND EACH IS APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE PHYSICAL COSMOS BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE NATURE OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0040 THE FIRST TWO GREW MAINLY OUT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL PHENOMENA WHILE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0041 THE THIRD IN GREAT MEASURE OWES ITS REHABILITATION IF NOT ITS ORIGIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0042 TO THE STUDY OF BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT TRUTHS APPLICABLE IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0043 TO MATTER IN GENERAL AND IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0044 TO PARTICULAR FORMS OF MATTER HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED BY THE PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS THE LAWS OF MOTION OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0045 OR MOLAR MATTER HAD BEEN WORKED OUT TO A GREAT DEGREE OF REFINEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0046 AND EMBODIED IN THE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE KNOWN AS MECHANICS HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0047 THESE LAWS HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0048 SO FAR AS THEY COULD BE CHECKED BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0049 ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL SUCH MASSES OF MATTER POSSESSED INERTIA AND WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF ACQUIRING MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0050 IN TWO WAYS FIRSTLY BY IMPACT OR IMPULSE FROM WITHOUT AND SECONDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0051 BY THE OPERATION OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL CAUSES OF MOTION TERMED FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0052 WHICH WERE USUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE RESIDENT IN THE PARTICLES OF THE MASSES THEMSELVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0053 AND TO OPERATE AT A DISTANCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TEND TO DRAW ANY TWO SUCH MASSES TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0054 OR TO SEPARATE THEM MORE WIDELY WITH RESPECT TO THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUTION OF THESE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0055 THE SAME TWO ANTAGONISTIC OPINIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED SINCE THE TIME OF DEMOCRITUS AND OF ARISTOTLE WERE STILL FACE TO FACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0056 ACCORDING TO THE ONE MATTER WAS DISCONTINUOUS AND CONSISTED OF MINUTE INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES OR ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0057 SEPARATED BY A UNIVERSAL VACUUM ACCORDING TO THE OTHER IT WAS CONTINUOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0058 AND THE FINEST DISTINGUISHABLE OR IMAGINABLE PARTICLES WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE ATTENUATED GENERAL SUBSTANCE OF THE PLENUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0059 A ROUGH ANALOGY TO THE LATTER CASE WOULD BE AFFORDED BY GRANULES OF ICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0060 DIFFUSED THROUGH WATER TO THE FORMER SUCH GRANULES DIFFUSED THROUGH ABSOLUTELY EMPTY SPACE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0061 THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE CHEMISTS HAD ARRIVED AT SEVERAL VERY IMPORTANT GENERALISATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0062 RESPECTING THOSE PROPERTIES OF MATTER WITH WHICH THEY WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0063 HOWEVER PLAINLY PONDERABLE MATTER SEEMED TO BE ORIGINATED AND DESTROYED IN THEIR OPERATIONS THEY PROVED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0064 AS MASS OR BODY IT REMAINED INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INGENERABLE AND THAT SO FAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0065 IT VARIED ONLY IN ITS PERCEPTIBILITY BY OUR SENSES THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION FURTHER PROVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0066 THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE CHEMICALLY SEPARABLE KINDS OF MATTER WERE UNALTERABLE BY ANY KNOWN MEANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0067 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY MIGHT BE MADE TO CHANGE THEIR STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0068 FROM SOLID TO FLUID OR VICE VERSA UNLESS THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER KINDS OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0069 AND THAT THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SEVERAL KINDS OF MATTER WERE ALWAYS THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0070 WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN ALL OTHER BODIES WERE FOUND TO CONSIST OF TWO OR MORE OF THESE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0071 WHICH THUS TOOK THE PLACE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS FURTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0072 IT WAS PROVED THAT IN FORMING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BODIES ALWAYS UNITE IN A DEFINITE PROPORTION BY WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0073 OR IN SIMPLE MULTIPLES OF THAT PROPORTION AND THAT IF ANY ONE BODY WERE TAKEN AS A STANDARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0074 EVERY OTHER COULD HAVE A NUMBER ASSIGNED TO IT AS ITS PROPORTIONAL COMBINING WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0075 IT WAS ON THIS FOUNDATION OF FACT THAT DALTON BASED HIS RE ESTABLISHMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0076 OF THE OLD ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS ON A NEW EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION IT IS OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0077 THAT IF ELEMENTARY MATTER CONSISTS OF INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES EACH OF WHICH CONSTANTLY PRESERVES THE SAME WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0078 RELATIVELY TO ALL THE OTHERS COMPOUNDS FORMED BY THE AGGREGATION OF TWO THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0079 FOUR OR MORE SUCH PARTICLES MUST EXEMPLIFY THE RULE OF COMBINATION IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0080 THE MEANWHILE THE GRADUAL RECEPTION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0081 NECESSITATED THE ASSUMPTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHER FILLING ALL SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0082 BUT WHETHER THIS ETHER WAS TO BE REGARDED AS A STRICTLY MATERIAL AND CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0083 WAS AN UNDECIDED POINT AND HENCE THE REVIVED ATOMISM ESCAPED STRANGLING IN ITS BIRTH FOR IT IS CLEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0084 THAT IF THE ETHER IS ADMITTED TO BE A CONTINUOUS MATERIAL SUBSTANCE DEMOCRITIC ATOMISM IS AT AN END
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0085 AND CARTESIAN CONTINUITY TAKES ITS PLACE THE REAL VALUE OF THE NEW ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0086 DID NOT LIE IN THE TWO POINTS WHICH DEMOCRITUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0087 NAMELY THE INDIVISIBILITY OF THE ATOMS AND THE PRESENCE OF AN INTERATOMIC VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0088 BUT IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR MEANS OF ANALYSIS TAKE US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0089 MATERIAL BODIES CONSIST OF DEFINITE MINUTE MASSES EACH OF WHICH SO FAR AS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES OF DIVISION GO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0090 MAY BE REGARDED AS A UNIT HAVING A PRACTICALLY PERMANENT INDIVIDUALITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0091 JUST AS A MAN IS THE UNIT OF SOCIOLOGY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL FACT OF HIS DIVISIBILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0092 SO SUCH A MINUTE MASS IS THE UNIT OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE THAT SMALLEST MATERIAL PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0093 WHICH UNDER ANY GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES ACTS AS A WHOLE MOLECULE WOULD BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE NAME FOR SUCH A PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0094 UNFORTUNATELY CHEMISTS EMPLOY THIS TERM IN A SPECIAL SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0095 AS A NAME FOR AN AGGREGATION OF THEIR SMALLEST PARTICLES FOR WHICH THEY RETAIN THE DESIGNATION OF ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0096 THE DOCTRINE OF SPECIFIC HEAT ORIGINATED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT MEANS THAT THE SAME MASS OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0097 UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES ALWAYS REQUIRES THE SAME QUANTITY OF HEAT TO RAISE IT TO A GIVEN TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0098 BUT THAT EQUAL MASSES OF DIFFERENT BODIES REQUIRE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES ULTIMATELY IT WAS FOUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0099 THAT THE QUANTITIES OF HEAT REQUIRED TO RAISE EQUAL MASSES OF THE MORE PERFECT GASES THROUGH EQUAL RANGES OF TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0100 WERE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS THUS A DEFINITE RELATION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0101 AND HEAT THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0102 CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN THESE UNITS AND ELECTRICITY THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE COMBINATION OF ANY TWO UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0103 IS SUFFICIENT TO SEPARATE ANY OTHER TWO WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF SUCH DECOMPOSITION THE PHENOMENA OF ISOMORPHISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0104 SHOWED A RELATION BETWEEN THE UNITS AND CRYSTALLINE FORMS CERTAIN UNITS ARE THUS ABLE TO REPLACE OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0105 IN A CRYSTALLINE BODY WITHOUT ALTERING ITS FORM AND OTHERS ARE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0106 AGAIN THE LAWS OF THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE AND HEAT ON GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0107 THE FACT THAT THEY COMBINE IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS BY VOLUME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0108 AND THAT SUCH PROPORTION BEARS A SIMPLE RELATION TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS ALL HARMONISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0109 WITH THE DALTONIAN HYPOTHESIS AND LED TO THE BOLD SPECULATION KNOWN AS THE LAW OF AVOGADRO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0110 THAT ALL GASEOUS BODIES UNDER THE SAME PHYSICAL CONDITIONS CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0111 IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT WAS FIRST ENUNCIATED THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS INCORRECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0112 PERHAPS IT IS NOT EXACTLY TRUE IN ANY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0113 BUT IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0114 WOULD NEVER HAVE ADVANCED TO THEIR PRESENT CONDITION UNLESS IT HAD BEEN ASSUMED TO BE TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0115 ANOTHER IMMENSE SERVICE RENDERED BY DALTON AS A COROLLARY OF THE NEW ATOMIC DOCTRINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0116 WAS THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF SYMBOLIC NOTATION WHICH NOT ONLY MADE THE NATURE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0117 AND PROCESSES EASILY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY OF RECOLLECTION BUT BY ITS VERY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0118 SUGGESTED NEW LINES OF INQUIRY THE ATOMIC NOTATION WAS AS SERVICEABLE TO CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0119 AS THE BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE AND THE CLASSIFICATORY SCHEMATISM OF LINNAEUS WERE TO ZOOELOGY AND BOTANY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THESE ADVANCES AROSE IN ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0120 WHICH ALSO HAS A CLOSE PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0121 IF THE UNIT OF A COMPOUND IS MADE UP BY THE AGGREGATION OF ELEMENTARY UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0122 THE NOTION THAT THESE MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0123 INEVITABLY SUGGESTS ITSELF AND SUCH PHENOMENA AS DOUBLE DECOMPOSITION POINTED NOT ONLY TO THE EXISTENCE OF A MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0124 BUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING A MOLECULAR FABRIC WITHOUT DESTROYING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0125 BY TAKING OUT SOME OF THE COMPONENT UNITS AND REPLACING THEM BY OTHERS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0126 CLASS OF NEUTRAL SALTS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES A GREAT NUMBER OF BODIES IN MANY WAYS SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0127 IN WHICH THE BASIC MOLECULES OR THE ACID MOLECULES MAY BE REPLACED BY OTHER BASIC
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0128 AND OTHER ACID MOLECULES WITHOUT ALTERING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE SALT JUST AS A CUBE OF BRICKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0129 REMAINS A CUBE SO LONG AS ANY BRICK THAT IS TAKEN OUT IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER OF THE SAME SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0130 WHATEVER ITS WEIGHT OR OTHER PROPERTIES MAY BE FACTS OF THIS KIND GAVE RISE TO THE CONCEPTION OF TYPES OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0131 JUST AS THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNITY IN DIVERSITY OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SPECIES OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0132 AND ANIMALS GAVE RISE TO THE NOTION OF BIOLOGICAL TYPES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0133 THE NOTATION OF CHEMISTRY ENABLED THESE IDEAS TO BE REPRESENTED WITH PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0134 AND THEY ACQUIRED AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHEN THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF ANALYSIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0135 WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0136 ENABLED THE COMPOSITION OF THE SO CALLED ORGANIC BODIES TO BE DETERMINED WITH RAPIDITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0137 AND PRECISION G AT PRESENT MORE ORGANIC ANALYSES ARE MADE IN A SINGLE DAY THAN WERE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE LIEBIG'S TIME IN A WHOLE YEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0138 A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS CONTAIN NOT MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0139 OF WHICH CARBON IS THE CHIEF BUT THEIR NUMBER IS VERY GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0140 AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES IS ASTONISHING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0141 THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE PROPORTION OF EACH ELEMENT IN THESE COMPOUNDS AFFORDS LITTLE OR NO HELP
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0142 TOWARDS ACCOUNTING FOR THEIR DIVERSITIES WIDELY DIFFERENT BODIES BEING OFTEN VERY SIMILAR OR EVEN IDENTICAL IN THAT RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0143 AND IN THE LAST CASE THAT OF ISOMERIC COMPOUNDS THE APPEAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0144 TO DIVERSITY OF ARRANGEMENT OF THE IDENTICAL COMPONENT UNITS WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0145 HERE AGAIN HYPOTHESIS PROVED TO BE OF GREAT VALUE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0146 ONLY WAS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF DIVERSITY OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE SUCCESSFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0147 BUT THE STUDY OF THE PROCESS OF TAKING TO PIECES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0148 LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE WAY TO PUT TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0149 AND VAST NUMBERS OF COMPOUNDS SOME OF THEM PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ONLY AS PRODUCTS OF THE LIVING ECONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0150 HAVE THUS BEEN ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRUCTED CHEMICAL WORK AT THE PRESENT DAY IS TO A LARGE EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0151 SYNTHETIC OR CREATIVE THAT IS TO SAY THE CHEMIST DETERMINES THEORETICALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0152 THAT CERTAIN NON EXISTENT COMPOUNDS OUGHT TO BE PRODUCIBLE AND HE PROCEEDS TO PRODUCE THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0153 IT IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OUR EPOCH HAVE PASSED INTO THIS DEDUCTIVE AND SYNTHETIC STAGE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE NAME OF THE NEW CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0154 WHICH THEY COMMONLY RECEIVE BUT THIS NEW CHEMISTRY HAS GROWN UP BY THE HELP OF HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0155 SUCH AS THOSE OF DALTON AND OF AVOGADRO AND THAT SINGULAR CONCEPTION OF BONDS INVENTED TO COLLIGATE THE FACTS OF VALENCY OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0156 ATOMICITY THE FIRST OF WHICH TOOK SOME TIME TO MAKE ITS WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0157 WHILE THE SECOND FELL INTO OBLIVION FOR MANY YEARS AFTER IT WAS PROPOUNDED FOR LACK OF EMPIRICAL JUSTIFICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0158 AS FOR THE THIRD IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF ANYONE REGARDS IT AS MORE THAN A TEMPORARY CONTRIVANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0159 BUT SOME OF THESE HYPOTHESES HAVE DONE YET FURTHER SERVICE COMBINING THEM WITH THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0160 AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0161 WHICH ARE ALSO PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME PHYSICISTS HAVE ARRIVED AT AN ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPTION OF THE NATURE OF GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0162 AND OF THE RELATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS OF MATTER TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0163 THE CONDUCT OF GASES UNDER VARYING PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE THEIR DIFFUSIBILITY THEIR RELATION TO RADIANT HEAT AND TO LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0164 THE EVOLUTION OF HEAT WHEN BODIES COMBINE THE ABSORPTION OF HEAT WHEN THEY ARE DISSOCIATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0165 AND A HOST OF OTHER MOLECULAR PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM THE DYNAMICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0166 AND STATICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH APPLY TO MOLAR MOTION AND REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0167 AND THE TENDENCY OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE IS CLEARLY TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0168 OF THE INFINITELY LITTLE AS IT ALREADY HAS REDUCED THOSE OF THE INFINITELY GREAT WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0169 TO QUESTIONS OF MECHANICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0170 IN THE MEANTIME THE PRIMITIVE ATOMIC THEORY WHICH HAS SERVED AS THE SCAFFOLDING FOR THE EDIFICE OF MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0171 HAS BEEN QUIETLY DISMISSED I CANNOT DISCOVER THAT ANY CONTEMPORARY PHYSICIST OR CHEMIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0172 BELIEVES IN THE REAL INDIVISIBILITY OF ATOMS OR IN AN INTERATOMIC MATTERLESS VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0173 ATOMS APPEAR TO BE USED AS MERE NAMES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0174 WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUBDIVIDED AND MOLECULES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0175 WHICH ARE AGGREGATES OF THE FORMER AND THESE INDIVIDUALISED PARTICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN AN ENDLESS OCEAN OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0176 A VASTLY MORE SUBTLE MATTER THE ETHER IF THIS ETHER IS A CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE THEREFORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0177 WE HAVE GOT BACK FROM THE HYPOTHESIS OF DALTON TO THAT OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0178 BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS GOING TO MAKE A STILL FURTHER JOURNEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0179 AND IN FORM IF NOT ALTOGETHER IN SUBSTANCE TO RETURN TO THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARISTOTLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0180 THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE SO CALLED ELEMENTARY BODIES NOW KNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0181 HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0182 AND IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS EQUALLY SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0183 BUT THAT SOME OF THEM AT ANY RATE CONSTITUTED GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0184 THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE AS MUCH LIKE ONE ANOTHER AS THEY WERE UNLIKE THE REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0185 CHLORINE IODINE BROMINE AND FLUORINE THUS FORMED A VERY DISTINCT GROUP SULPHUR AND SELENIUM ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0186 BORON AND SILICON ANOTHER POTASSIUM SODIUM AND LITHIUM ANOTHER AND SO ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0187 IN SOME CASES THE ATOMIC WEIGHTS OF SUCH ALLIED BODIES WERE NEARLY THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0188 OR COULD BE ARRANGED IN SERIES WITH LIKE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL TERMS IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0189 THE ELEMENTS AFFORDED INDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF A CLASSIFICATION IN NATURAL GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0190 SUCH AS THOSE INTO WHICH ANIMALS AND PLANTS FALL RECENTLY THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP AFRESH WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0191 A RESULT WHICH MAY BE STATED ROUGHLY IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS IF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0192 THE SIXTY FIVE OR SIXTY EIGHT RECOGNISED ELEMENTS ARE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR ATOMIC WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0193 FROM HYDROGEN THE LIGHTEST AS UNITY TO URANIUM THE HEAVIEST AS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0194 THE SERIES DOES NOT EXHIBIT ONE CONTINUOUS PROGRESSIVE MODIFICATION IN THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF ITS SEVERAL TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0195 BUT BREAKS UP INTO A NUMBER OF SECTIONS IN EACH OF WHICH THE SEVERAL TERMS PRESENT ANALOGIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0196 WITH THE CORRESPONDING TERMS OF THE OTHER SERIES THUS THE WHOLE SERIES DOES NOT RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0197 A B D E F G H I K ETCETERA BUT A B C D
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0198 CAPITAL A CAPITAL B CAPITAL C CAPITAL D ALPHA BETA GAMMA DELTA ETCETERA SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0199 THAT IT IS SAID TO EXPRESS A PERIODIC LAW OF RECURRENT SIMILARITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0200 OR THE RELATION MAY BE EXPRESSED IN ANOTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0201 IN EACH SECTION OF THE SERIES THE ATOMIC WEIGHT IS GREATER THAN IN THE PRECEDING SECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0202 SO THAT IF W IS THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE FIRST SEGMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0203 W PLUS X WILL REPRESENT THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0204 AND W PLUS X PLUS Y THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT AND SO ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0205 THEREFORE THE SECTIONS MAY BE REPRESENTED AS PARALLEL SERIES THE CORRESPONDING TERMS OF WHICH HAVE ANALOGOUS PROPERTIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0206 EACH SUCCESSIVE SERIES STARTING WITH A BODY THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0207 IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY IN THE PRECEDING SERIES IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION

knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0209 W PLUS X COLUMN THREE DELTA GAMMA BETA ALPHA W PLUS X PLUS Y
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0210 THIS IS A CONCEPTION WITH WHICH BIOLOGISTS ARE VERY FAMILIAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0211 ANIMAL AND PLANT GROUPS CONSTANTLY APPEARING AS SERIES OF PARALLEL MODIFICATIONS OF SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0212 AND YET DIFFERENT PRIMARY FORMS IN THE LIVING WORLD FACTS OF THIS KIND ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN EVOLUTION FROM A COMMON PROTOTYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0213 IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT IN THE NOT LIVING WORLD THEY ARE DEVOID OF SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0214 IS IT NOT POSSIBLE NAY PROBABLE THAT THEY MAY MEAN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMARY UNDIFFERENTIATED FORM OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0215 FIFTY YEARS AGO SUCH A SUGGESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN SCOUTED AS A REVIVAL OF THE DREAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0216 OF THE ALCHEMISTS AT PRESENT IT MAY BE SAID TO BE THE BURNING QUESTION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0217 IN FACT THE SO CALLED VORTEX RING HYPOTHESIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND REMARKABLE ATTEMPT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0218 TO DEAL WITH MATERIAL UNITS FROM A POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0219 IT SUPPOSES THE ETHER TO BE A UNIFORM SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0220 AND THAT THE ELEMENTARY UNITS ARE BROADLY SPEAKING PERMANENT WHIRLPOOLS OR VORTICES OF THIS ETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0221 THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH DEPEND ON THEIR ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL MODES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0222 IT IS CURIOUS AND HIGHLY INTERESTING TO REMARK THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS REMINDS US NOT ONLY OF THE SPECULATIONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0223 BUT OF THOSE OF ARISTOTLE THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE VORTEX RINGS TO THE TOURBILLONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0224 IS LITTLE MORE THAN NOMINAL BUT THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE MODERN AND THE ANCIENT NOTION OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND DERIVATIVE MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0225 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REAL FOR THIS ETHEREAL URSTOFF OF THE MODERN CORRESPONDS VERY CLOSELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0226 WITH THE PRHOTE HYLE OF ARISTOTLE THE MATERIA PRIMA OF HIS MEDIAEVAL FOLLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0227 WHILE MATTER DIFFERENTIATED INTO OUR ELEMENTS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PROGRESS TOWARDS THE HESCHHATE HYLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0228 OR FINISHED MATTER OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY IF THE MATERIAL UNITS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF NATURE ARE SPECIALISED PORTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0229 OF A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS MATERIA PRIMA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0230 WHICH WERE ORIGINATED UNDER CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LONG CEASED TO EXIST AND WHICH REMAIN UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE UNDER ALL CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0231 WHETHER NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL HITHERTO KNOWN TO US IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SPECULATION THAT THEY MAY BE INDEFINITELY ALTERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0232 OR THAT NEW UNITS MAY BE GENERATED UNDER CONDITIONS YET TO BE DISCOVERED IS PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0233 THEORETICALLY AT ANY RATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0234 THE TRANSMUTABILITY OF THE ELEMENTS IS A VERIFIABLE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS AND SUCH INQUIRIES AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN SET AFOOT INTO THE POSSIBLE DISSOCIATIVE ACTION OF THE GREAT HEAT OF THE SUN UPON OUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0235 ARE NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT ARE LIKELY TO YIELD RESULTS WHICH WHETHER AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0236 WILL BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE IDEA THAT ATOMS ARE ABSOLUTELY INGENERABLE AND IMMUTABLE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0237 STANDS ON THE SAME SORT OF FOUNDATION AS THE IDEA THAT BIOLOGICAL SPECIES ARE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES STOOD THIRTY YEARS AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0238 AND THE SUPPOSED CONSTANCY OF THE ELEMENTARY ATOMS DURING THE ENORMOUS LAPSE OF TIME MEASURED BY THE EXISTENCE OF OUR UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0239 IS OF NO MORE WEIGHT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE IN THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0240 IN THE INFINITY OF ANTECEDENT TIME THAN THE CONSTANCY OF SPECIES IN EGYPT SINCE THE DAYS OF RAMESES OR CHEOPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0241 IS EVIDENCE OF THEIR IMMUTABILITY DURING ALL PAST EPOCHS OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0242 IT SEEMS SAFE TO PROPHESY THAT THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMITIVE MATTER WILL IN FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0243 PLAY NO LESS A PART IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0244 THAN THE ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS WHICH TO BEGIN WITH HAD NO GREATER IF SO GREAT AN EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0245 IT MAY PERHAPS OCCUR TO THE READER THAT THE BOASTED PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DOES NOT COME TO MUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0246 IF OUR PRESENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF MATTER ARE EXPRESSIBLE IN TERMS EMPLOYED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO BY THE OLD MASTER OF THOSE THAT KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0247 SUCH A CRITICISM HOWEVER WOULD INVOLVE FORGETFULNESS OF THE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0248 THAT THE CONNOTATION OF THESE TERMS IN THE MIND OF THE MODERN IS ALMOST INFINITELY DIFFERENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0249 FROM THAT WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE MIND OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0250 IN ANTIQUITY THEY MEANT LITTLE MORE THAN VAGUE SPECULATION AT THE PRESENT DAY THEY INDICATE DEFINITE PHYSICAL CONCEPTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0251 SUSCEPTIBLE OF MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT AND GIVING RISE TO INNUMERABLE DEDUCTIONS THE VALUE OF WHICH CAN BE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0252 THE OLD NOTIONS PRODUCED LITTLE MORE THAN FLOODS OF DIALECTICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0253 THE NEW ARE POWERFUL AIDS TOWARDS THE INCREASE OF SOLID KNOWLEDGE EVERYDAY OBSERVATION SHOWS THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0254 OF THE BODIES WHICH COMPOSE THE MATERIAL WORLD SOME ARE IN MOTION AND SOME ARE OR APPEAR TO BE AT REST OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0255 THE BODIES IN MOTION SOME LIKE THE SUN AND STARS EXHIBIT A CONSTANT MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0256 REGULAR IN AMOUNT AND DIRECTION FOR WHICH NO EXTERNAL CAUSE APPEARS OTHERS AS STONES AND SMOKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0257 SEEM ALSO TO MOVE OF THEMSELVES WHEN EXTERNAL IMPEDIMENTS ARE TAKEN AWAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0258 BUT THESE APPEAR TO TEND TO MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE BODIES WE CALL HEAVY SUCH AS STONES DOWNWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0259 AND THE BODIES WE CALL LIGHT AT LEAST SUCH AS SMOKE AND STEAM UPWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0260 AND AS WE FURTHER NOTICE THAT THE EARTH BELOW OUR FEET IS MADE UP OF HEAVY MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0261 WHILE THE AIR ABOVE OUR HEADS IS EXTREMELY LIGHT MATTER IT IS EASY TO REGARD THIS FACT AS EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0262 THAT THE LOWER REGION IS THE PLACE TO WHICH HEAVY THINGS TEND THEIR PROPER PLACE IN SHORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0263 WHILE THE UPPER REGION IS THE PROPER PLACE OF LIGHT THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0264 AND TO GENERALISE THE FACTS OBSERVED BY SAYING THAT BODIES WHICH ARE FREE TO MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0265 TEND TOWARDS THEIR PROPER PLACES ALL THESE SEEM TO BE NATURAL MOTIONS DEPENDENT ON THE INHERENT FACULTIES OR TENDENCIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0266 OF BODIES THEMSELVES BUT THERE ARE OTHER MOTIONS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIAL OR VIOLENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0267 AS WHEN A STONE IS THROWN FROM THE HAND OR IS KNOCKED BY ANOTHER STONE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0268 IN SUCH CASES AS THESE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A STONE IS CAST FROM THE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0269 THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE STONE APPEARS TO DEPEND PARTLY ON ITS WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0270 AND PARTLY UPON THE EXERTION OF THE THROWER SO THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE REMAINING THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0271 IT LOOKS AS IF THE MOTIVE POWER COMMUNICATED TO IT WERE MEASURED BY THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE STONE TRAVELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0272 AS IF IN OTHER WORDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0273 THE POWER NEEDED TO SEND IT A HUNDRED YARDS WAS TWICE AS GREAT AS THAT NEEDED TO SEND IT FIFTY YARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0274 THESE APPARENTLY OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EVERYDAY APPEARANCES OF REST AND MOTION FAIRLY REPRESENT THE STATE OF OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0275 WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND REMAINED DOMINANT UNTIL THE AGE OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0276 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPIA OF NEWTON IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVEN MARKS THE EPOCH AT WHICH THE PROGRESS OF MECHANICAL PHYSICS HAD EFFECTED A COMPLETE REVOLUTION OF THOUGHT ON THESE SUBJECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0277 BY THIS TIME IT HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT THE OLD GENERALISATIONS WERE EITHER INCOMPLETE OR TOTALLY ERRONEOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0278 THAT A BODY ONCE SET IN MOTION WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0279 FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE TIME OR DISTANCE UNLESS IT IS INTERFERED WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0280 THAT ANY CHANGE OF MOTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE WHICH CAUSES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0281 AND TAKES PLACE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THAT FORCE IS EXERTED AND THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0282 WHEN A BODY IN MOTION ACTS AS A CAUSE OF MOTION ON ANOTHER THE LATTER GAINS AS MUCH AS THE FORMER LOSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0283 AND VICE VERSA IT IS TO BE NOTED HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0284 THAT WHILE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE ANCIENT IDEA OF THE INHERENT TENDENCY TO MOTION OF BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0285 THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH SPONTANEOUS POWER OF MOTION WAS ACCEPTED AS A PHYSICAL AXIOM BY THE MODERNS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0286 THE OLD CONCEPTION VIRTUALLY MAINTAINED ITSELF IS A NEW SHAPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0287 FOR IN SPITE OF NEWTON'S WELL KNOWN WARNING AGAINST THE ABSURDITY OF SUPPOSING THAT ONE BODY CAN ACT ON ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0288 AT A DISTANCE THROUGH A VACUUM THE ULTIMATE PARTICLES OF MATTER WERE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE THE SEATS OF PERENNIAL CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0289 OF MOTION TERMED ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES IN VIRTUE OF WHICH ANY TWO SUCH PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0290 WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL IMPRESSION OF MOTION OR INTERMEDIATE MATERIAL AGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0291 WERE SUPPOSED TO TEND TO APPROACH OR REMOVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0292 AND THIS VIEW OF THE DUALITY OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0293 IS VERY WIDELY HELD AT THE PRESENT DAY ANOTHER IMPORTANT RESULT OF INVESTIGATION ATTAINED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0294 THE PROOF AND QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF PHYSICAL INERTIA IN THE OLD PHILOSOPHY A CURIOUS CONJUNCTION OF ETHICAL AND PHYSICAL PREJUDICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0295 HAD LED TO THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ETHICALLY BAD AND PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTIVE ABOUT MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0296 ARISTOTLE ATTRIBUTES ALL IRREGULARITIES AND APPARENT DYSTELEOLOGIES IN NATURE TO THE DISOBEDIENCE OR SLUGGISH YIELDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0297 OF MATTER TO THE SHAPING AND GUIDING INFLUENCE OF THOSE REASONS AND CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0298 WHICH WERE HYPOTHESIZED IN HIS IDEAL FORMS IN MODERN SCIENCE THE CONCEPTION OF THE INERTIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0299 OR RESISTANCE TO CHANGE OF MATTER IS COMPLEX IN PART IT CONTAINS A COROLLARY FROM THE LAW OF CAUSATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0300 A BODY CANNOT CHANGE ITS STATE IN RESPECT OF REST OR MOTION WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0301 BUT IN PART IT CONTAINS GENERALISATIONS FROM EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0302 ONE OF THESE IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH SUFFICIENT CAUSE RESIDENT IN ANY BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0303 AND THAT THEREFORE IT WILL REST OR CONTINUE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0304 SO LONG AS NO EXTERNAL CAUSE OF CHANGE ACTS UPON IT THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0305 IS THAT THE EFFECT WHICH THE IMPACT OF A BODY IN MOTION PRODUCES UPON THE BODY ON WHICH IT IMPINGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0306 DEPENDS OTHER THINGS BEING ALIKE ON THE RELATION OF A CERTAIN QUALITY OF EACH WHICH IS CALLED MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0307 GIVEN A CAUSE OF MOTION OF A CERTAIN VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0308 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION MEASURED BY DISTANCE TRAVELLED IN A CERTAIN TIME WHICH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0309 WILL PRODUCE IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF MATTER SAY A CUBIC INCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0310 IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT THAT MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0311 A CUBIC INCH OF IRON WILL GO FASTER THAN A CUBIC INCH OF GOLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0312 HENCE IT APPEARS THAT SINCE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF MOTION HAVE EX HYPOTHESI BEEN PRODUCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0313 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION IN A BODY DOES NOT DEPEND ON ITS SPEED ALONE BUT ON SOME PROPERTY OF THE BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0314 TO THIS THE NAME OF MASS HAS BEEN GIVEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0315 SINCE IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT A LARGE QUANTITY OF MATTER MOVING SLOWLY POSSESSES AS MUCH MOTION AS A SMALL QUANTITY MOVING FASTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0316 MASS HAS BEEN HELD TO EXPRESS QUANTITY OF MATTER IT IS FURTHER DEMONSTRABLE THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0317 THE RELATIVE MASS OF ANY TWO BODIES IS EXPRESSED BY THE RATIO OF THEIR WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0318 WHEN ALL THESE GREAT TRUTHS RESPECTING MOLAR MOTION OR THE MOVEMENTS OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0319 HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD NOT ONLY OF TERRESTRIAL BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0320 BUT OF ALL THOSE WHICH CONSTITUTE THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MACROCOSM HAD THUS BEEN EXPRESSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0321 BY A GENERAL MECHANICAL THEORY THERE REMAINED A VAST NUMBER OF PHENOMENA SUCH AS THOSE OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0322 HEAT ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM AND THOSE OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES WHICH DO NOT INVOLVE MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0323 NEWTON'S CORPUSCULAR THEORY OF LIGHT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH ONE GREAT SERIES OF THESE PHENOMENA ON MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0324 AND IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND UNTIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0325 THE UNDULATORY THEORY PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MUCH BETTER WORKING HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0326 HEAT UP TO THAT TIME AND INDEED MUCH LATER WAS REGARDED AS AN IMPONDERABLE SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0327 CALORIC AS A THING WHICH WAS ABSORBED BY BODIES WHEN THEY WERE WARMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0328 AND WAS GIVEN OUT AS THEY COOLED AND WHICH MOREOVER WAS CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO A SORT OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THEM AND SO BECOMING LATENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0329 RUMFORD AND DAVY HAD GIVEN A GREAT BLOW TO THIS VIEW OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0330 BY PROVING THAT THE QUANTITY OF HEAT WHICH TWO PORTIONS OF THE SAME BODY COULD BE MADE TO GIVE OUT BY RUBBING THEM TOGETHER WAS PRACTICALLY ILLIMITABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0331 THIS RESULT BROUGHT PHILOSOPHERS FACE TO FACE WITH THE CONTRADICTION OF SUPPOSING THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0332 A FINITE BODY COULD CONTAIN AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF ANOTHER BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0333 BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0334 THAT CLEAR AND UNQUESTIONABLE EXPERIMENTAL PROOF WAS GIVEN OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE RELATION BETWEEN MECHANICAL WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0335 AND HEAT THAT SO MUCH WORK ALWAYS GIVES RISE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS TO SO MUCH HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0336 AND SO MUCH HEAT TO SO MUCH MECHANICAL WORK THUS ORIGINATED THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0337 WHICH BECAME THE STARTING POINT OF THE MODERN DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0338 MOLAR MOTION HAD APPEARED TO BE DESTROYED BY FRICTION IT WAS PROVED THAT NO DESTRUCTION TOOK PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0339 BUT THAT AN EXACT EQUIVALENT OF THE ENERGY OF THE LOST MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0340 APPEARS AS THAT OF THE MOLECULAR MOTION OR MOTION OF THE SMALLEST PARTICLES OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0341 WHICH CONSTITUTES HEAT THE LOSS OF THE MASSES IS THE GAIN OF THEIR PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0342 BEFORE EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE HOWEVER THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY HAD BEEN APPROACHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0343 BACON'S CHIEF CONTRIBUTION TO POSITIVE SCIENCE IS THE HAPPY GUESS FOR THE CONTEXT SHOWS THAT IT WAS LITTLE MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0344 THAT HEAT MAY BE A MODE OF MOTION DESCARTES AFFIRMED THE QUANTITY OF MOTION IN THE WORLD TO BE CONSTANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0345 NEWTON NEARLY GAVE EXPRESSION TO THE COMPLETE THEOREM WHILE RUMFORD'S AND DAVY'S EXPERIMENTS SUGGESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0346 THOUGH THEY DID NOT PROVE THE EQUIVALENCY OF MECHANICAL AND THERMAL ENERGY AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0347 THE DISCOVERY OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY AND THE MARVELLOUS DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IN THAT FIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0348 EFFECTED BY SUCH MEN AS DAVY FARADAY OERSTED AMPERE AND MELLONI
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0349 HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT A NUMBER OF FACTS WHICH TENDED TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0350 THAT THE SO CALLED FORCES AT WORK IN LIGHT HEAT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0351 CHEMICAL AND IN MECHANICAL OPERATIONS WERE INTIMATELY AND IN VARIOUS CASES QUANTITATIVELY RELATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0352 IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY ONE COULD BE OBTAINED AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0353 AND APPARATUS WAS DEVISED WHICH EXHIBITED THE EVOLUTION OF ALL THESE KINDS OF ACTION FROM ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0354 HENCE THE IDEA OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES WHICH WAS THE IMMEDIATE FORERUNNER OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0355 IT IS A REMARKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE GREATNESS OF THE PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0356 WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN OUR TIME THAT EVEN THE SECOND EDITION OF THE HISTORY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0357 WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX CONTAINS NO ALLUSION EITHER TO THE GENERAL VIEW OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0358 TO THE PUBLICATION IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0359 OF THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT WAS CORRECTLY ASCERTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0360 THIS IS THE MORE CURIOUS AS AMPERE'S HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0361 THAT VIBRATIONS OF MOLECULES CAUSING AND CAUSED BY VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER CONSTITUTE HEAT IS DISCUSSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0362 WHEWELL REMARKS A PROPOS OF BACON'S DEFINITION OF HEAT THAT IT IS AN EXPANSIVE RESTRAINED MOTION MODIFIED IN CERTAIN WAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0363 AND EXERTED IN THE SMALLER PARTICLES OF THE BODY THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0364 ALTHOUGH THE EXACT NATURE OF HEAT IS STILL AN OBSCURE AND CONTROVERTED MATTER THE SCIENCE OF HEAT NOW CONSISTS OF MANY IMPORTANT TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0365 AND THAT TO NONE OF THESE TRUTHS IS THERE ANY APPROXIMATION IN BACON'S ESSAY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0366 POINT OF FACT BACON'S STATEMENT HOWEVER MUCH OPEN TO CRITICISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0367 DOES CONTAIN A DISTINCT APPROXIMATION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0368 RESPECTING HEAT WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOVERED WHEN WHEWELL WROTE SUCH A FAILURE ON THE PART OF A CONTEMPORARY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0369 OF GREAT ACQUIREMENTS AND REMARKABLE INTELLECTUAL POWERS TO READ THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0370 IS A LESSON AND A WARNING WORTHY OF BEING DEEPLY PONDERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0371 BY ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO PROGNOSTICATE THE COURSE OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS END OF SECTION TWO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv/wav/adv0372 THIS HAS BEEN A LIBRIVOX RECORDING ALL LIBRIVOX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0001 SECTION THREE OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0003 I HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE GROWTH OF CLEAR AND DEFINITE VIEWS RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0004 HAS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0005 SO FAR AS NATURAL AGENCIES ARE CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0006 IT IS INGENERABLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0007 IN SO FAR AS MATTER MAY BE CONCEIVED TO EXIST IN A PURELY PASSIVE STATE IT IS IMAGINABLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0008 OLDER THAN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0009 BUT AS IT MUST BE ASSUMED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF MOTION A PARTICLE OF BARE MATTER AT REST MUST BE ENDOWED WITH THE POTENTIALITY OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0010 SUCH A PARTICLE HOWEVER BY THE SUPPOSITION CAN HAVE NO ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0011 FOR THERE IS NO CAUSE WHY IT SHOULD MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0012 SUPPOSE NOW THAT IT RECEIVES AN IMPULSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0013 IT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE WITH A VELOCITY INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0014 ON THE ONE HAND AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0015 DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0016 AND WILL POSSESS KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0017 IN VIRTUE OF WHICH IT WILL NOT ONLY CONTINUE TO MOVE FOR EVER IF UNIMPEDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0018 BUT IF IT IMPINGES ON ANOTHER SUCH PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0019 IT WILL IMPART MORE OR LESS OF ITS MOTION TO THE LATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0020 LET IT BE CONCEIVED THAT THE PARTICLE ACQUIRES A TENDENCY TO MOVE AND THAT NEVERTHELESS IT DOES NOT MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0021 IT IS THEN IN A CONDITION TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS AT FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0022 A CAUSE COMPETENT TO PRODUCE MOTION IS OPERATING UPON IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0023 BUT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0024 IS UNABLE TO GIVE RISE TO MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0025 IF THE OBSTACLE IS REMOVED THE ENERGY WHICH WAS THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0026 BUT COULD NOT MANIFEST ITSELF AT ONCE GIVES RISE TO MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0027 WHILE THE RESTRAINT LASTS THE ENERGY OF THE PARTICLE IS MERELY POTENTIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0028 AND THE CASE SUPPOSED ILLUSTRATES WHAT IS MEANT BY POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0029 IN THIS CONTRAST OF THE POTENTIAL WITH THE ACTUAL MODERN PHYSICS IS TURNING TO ACCOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0030 THE MOST FAMILIAR OF ARISTOTELIAN DISTINCTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0031 THAT BETWEEN DUNAMIS AND ENERGEIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0032 THAT KINETIC ENERGY APPEARS TO BE IMPARTED BY IMPACT IS A FACT OF DAILY AND HOURLY EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0033 WE SEE BODIES SET IN MOTION BY BODIES ALREADY IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0034 WHICH SEEM TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0035 IT IS A TRUTH WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNED BY NOTHING BUT EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0036 AND WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0037 BUT MUST BE TAKEN AS AN ULTIMATE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0038 ABOUT WHICH EXPLICABLE OR INEXPLICABLE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0039 STRICTLY SPEAKING WE HAVE NO DIRECT APPREHENSION OF ANY OTHER CAUSE OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0040 BUT EXPERIENCE FURNISHES INNUMERABLE EXAMPLES OF THE PRODUCTION OF KINETIC ENERGY IN A BODY PREVIOUSLY AT REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0041 WHEN NO IMPACT IS DISCERNIBLE AS THE CAUSE OF THAT ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0042 IN ALL SUCH CASES THE PRESENCE OF A SECOND BODY IS A NECESSARY CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0043 AND THE AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0044 WHICH ITS PRESENCE ENABLES THE FIRST TO GAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0045 IS STRICTLY DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0046 TWO HENCE THE PHRASE ENERGY OF POSITION WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0047 IS FREQUENTLY USED AS EQUIVALENT TO POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0048 IF A STONE IS PICKED UP AND HELD SAY SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0049 IT HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY BECAUSE IF LET GO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0050 WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0051 AND THIS ENERGY MAY BE SAID TO BE ENERGY OF POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0052 BECAUSE IT DEPENDS UPON THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE EARTH AND THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0053 STONE THE STONE IS SOLICITED TO MOVE BUT CANNOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0054 SO LONG AS THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH OF THE HOLDER PREVENTS THE SOLICITATION FROM TAKING EFFECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0055 THE STONE THEREFORE HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0056 WHICH BECOMES KINETIC IF IT IS LET GO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0057 AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT KINETIC ENERGY WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED BEFORE IT STRIKES THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0058 DEPENDS ON ITS POSITION ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0059 THE FACT THAT IT IS SAY SIX FEET OFF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0060 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0061 MOREOVER IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THE RAISER OF THE STONE HAD TO EXERT AS MUCH ENERGY IN ORDER TO PLACE IT IN ITS POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0062 AS IT WILL DEVELOP IN FALLING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0063 HENCE THE ENERGY WHICH WAS EXERTED AND APPARENTLY EXHAUSTED IN RAISING THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0064 IS POTENTIALLY IN THE STONE IN ITS RAISED POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0065 AND WILL MANIFEST ITSELF WHEN THE STONE IS SET FREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0066 THUS THE ENERGY WITHDRAWN FROM THE GENERAL STOCK TO RAISE THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0067 IS RETURNED WHEN IT FALLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0068 AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0069 ENERGY AS A WHOLE IS CONSERVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0070a TAKING THIS AS A VERY BROAD AND GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTS OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0070b THE RAISING OF THE STONE IS INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH AS A CASE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF MOTION FROM ONE BODY TO ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0071 BUT THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF THE RAISED STONE IS NOT SO EASILY INTELLIGIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0072 TO ALL APPEARANCE THERE IS NOTHING EITHER PUSHING OR PULLING IT TOWARDS THE EARTH OR THE EARTH TOWARDS IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0073 AND YET IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE STONE TENDS TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0074 AND THE EARTH TOWARDS THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0075 IN THE WAY DEFINED BY THE LAW OF GRAVITATION IN THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0076 CURRENTLY ACCEPTED LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE THE CAUSE OF MOTION IN ALL SUCH CASES AS THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0077 WHEN BODIES TEND TO MOVE TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM ONE OR ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0078 WITHOUT ANY DISCERNIBLE IMPACT OF OTHER BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0079 IS TERMED A FORCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0080 WHICH IS CALLED ATTRACTIVE IN THE ONE CASE AND REPULSIVE IN THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0081 AND SUCH ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FORCES ARE OFTEN SPOKEN OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0082 AS IF THEY WERE REAL THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0083 CAPABLE OF EXERTING A PULL OR A PUSH UPON THE PARTICLES OF MATTER CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0084 THUS THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0085 IS COMMONLY SAID TO BE DUE TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0086 WHICH IS CONTINUALLY OPERATING UPON IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0087 ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION MAY MAKE THE CASE PLAINER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0088 THE BOB OF A PENDULUM SWINGS FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER OF THE CENTRE OF THE ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0089 WHICH IT DESCRIBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0090 SUPPOSE IT TO HAVE JUST REACHED THE SUMMIT OF ITS RIGHT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0091 IT IS SAID THAT THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES OF THE BOB FOR THE EARTH AND OF THE EARTH FOR THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0092 SET THE FORMER IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0093 AND AS THESE FORCES ARE CONTINUALLY IN OPERATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0094 THEY CONFER AN ACCELERATED VELOCITY ON THE BOB UNTIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0095 WHEN IT REACHES THE CENTRE OF ITS SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0096 IT IS SO TO SPEAK FULLY CHARGED WITH KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0097 IF AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE MATERIAL UNIVERSE EXCEPT THE BOB WERE ABOLISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0098 IT WOULD MOVE FOR EVER IN THE DIRECTION OF A TANGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0099 TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ARC DESCRIBED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0100 AS A MATTER OF FACT IT IS COMPELLED TO TRAVEL THROUGH ITS LEFT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0101 AND THUS VIRTUALLY TO GO UP HILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0102 CONSEQUENTLY THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES OF THE BOB AND THE EARTH ARE NOW ACTING AGAINST IT AND CONSTITUTE A RESISTANCE WHICH THE CHARGE OF KINETIC ENERGY HAS TO OVERCOME
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0103 BUT AS THIS CHARGE REPRESENTS THE OPERATION OF THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0104 THROUGH THE RIGHT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0105 DOWN TO THE CENTRE OF THE ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0106 SO IT MUST NEEDS BE USED UP BY THE PASSAGE OF THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0107 UPWARDS FROM THE CENTRE OF THE ARC TO THE SUMMIT OF THE LEFT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0108 HENCE AT THIS POINT THE BOB COMES TO A MOMENTARY REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0109 THE LAST FRACTION OF KINETIC ENERGY IS JUST NEUTRALISED BY THE ACTION OF THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0110 AND THE BOB HAS ONLY POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0111 EQUAL TO THAT WITH WHICH IT STARTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0112 SO THAT THE SUM OF THE PHENOMENA MAY BE STATED THUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0113 AT THE SUMMIT OF EITHER HALF ARC OF ITS SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0114 THE BOB HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0115 AS IT DESCENDS IT GRADUALLY EXCHANGES THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0116 FOR KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0117 UNTIL AT THE CENTRE IT POSSESSES AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0118 FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS IT GRADUALLY LOSES KINETIC ENERGY AS IT ASCENDS UNTIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0119 AT THE SUMMIT OF THE OTHER HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0120 IT HAS ACQUIRED AN EXACTLY SIMILAR AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0121 THUS ON THE WHOLE TRANSACTION NOTHING IS EITHER LOST OR GAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0122 THE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IS ALWAYS THE SAME BUT IT PASSES FROM ONE FORM INTO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0123 TO ALL APPEARANCE THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY THE PENDULUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0124 ARE NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY IMPACT IN FACT IT IS USUALLY ASSUMED THAT CORRESPONDING PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0125 WOULD TAKE PLACE IF THE EARTH AND THE PENDULUM WERE SITUATED IN AN ABSOLUTE VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0126 AND AT ANY CONCEIVABLE DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0127 IF THIS BE SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0128 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE MUST BE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAUSES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0129 THE ONE IMPACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0130 A VERA CAUSA OF WHICH TO ALL APPEARANCE WE HAVE CONSTANT EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0131 THE OTHER ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FORCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0132 A METAPHYSICAL ENTITY WHICH IS PHYSICALLY INCONCEIVABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0133 NEWTON EXPRESSLY REPUDIATED THE NOTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF ATTRACTIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0134 IN THE SENSE IN WHICH THAT TERM IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0135 AND HE REFUSED TO PUT FORWARD ANY HYPOTHESIS AS TO THE PHYSICAL CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0136 OF THE SO CALLED ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0137 AS A GENERAL RULE HIS SUCCESSORS HAVE BEEN CONTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0138 TO ACCEPT THE DOCTRINE OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES WITHOUT TROUBLING THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH IT INVOLVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0139 BUT THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0140 AND THE ATTEMPT OF LE SAGE IN THE LAST CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0141 TO SHOW THAT THE PHENOMENA OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXPLANATION BY HIS HYPOTHESIS OF BOMBARDMENT BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0142 ULTRA MUNDANE PARTICLES WHETHER TENABLE OR NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0143 HAS THE GREAT MERIT OF BEING AN ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THE DUAL CONCEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0144 OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION WHICH HAS HITHERTO PREVAILED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0145 ON THIS HYPOTHESIS THE HAMMERING OF THE ULTRA MUNDANE CORPUSCLES ON THE BOB CONFERS ITS KINETIC ENERGY ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0146 AND TAKES IT AWAY ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0147 AND THE STATE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MEANS THE CONDITION OF THE BOB DURING THE INSTANT AT WHICH THE ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0148 CONFERRED BY THE HAMMERING DURING THE ONE HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0149 HAS JUST BEEN EXHAUSTED BY THE HAMMERING DURING THE OTHER HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0150 IT SEEMS SAFE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN THE CONCEPTION OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0151 HAVING SERVED ITS PURPOSE AS A USEFUL PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC SCAFFOLDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0152 WILL BE REPLACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0153 BY THE DEDUCTION OF THE PHENOMENA KNOWN AS ATTRACTION AND REPULSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0154 FROM THE GENERAL LAWS OF MOTION THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0155 DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ILLUSTRATE IS THUS DEFINED BY THE LATE CLERK MAXWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0156 THE TOTAL ENERGY OF ANY BODY OR SYSTEM OF BODIES IS A QUANTITY WHICH CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0157 BY ANY MUTUAL ACTION OF SUCH BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0158 THOUGH IT MAY BE TRANSFORMED INTO ANY ONE OF THE FORMS OF WHICH ENERGY IS SUSCEPTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0159 IT FOLLOWS THAT ENERGY LIKE MATTER IS INDESTRUCTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0160 AND INGENERABLE IN NATURE THE PHENOMENAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0161 SO FAR AS IT IS MATERIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0162 EXPRESSES THE EVOLUTION AND INVOLUTION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0163 ITS PASSAGE FROM THE KINETIC TO THE POTENTIAL CONDITION AND BACK AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0164 WHEREVER MOTION OF MATTER TAKES PLACE THAT MOTION IS EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0165 AT THE EXPENSE OF PART OF THE TOTAL STORE OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0166 HENCE AS THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY LIVING BEINGS IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE MATERIAL ARE ALL MOLAR OR MOLECULAR MOTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0167 THESE ARE INCLUDED UNDER THE GENERAL LAW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0168 A LIVING BODY IS A MACHINE BY WHICH ENERGY IS TRANSFORMED IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0169 THE SAME SENSE AS A STEAM ENGINE IS SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0170 AND ALL ITS MOVEMENTS MOLAR AND MOLECULAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0171 ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0172 BY THE ENERGY WHICH IS SUPPLIED TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0173 THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH ARISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0174 ALONG WITH CERTAIN TRANSFORMATIONS OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0175 CANNOT BE INTERPOLATED IN THE SERIES OF THESE TRANSFORMATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0176 INASMUCH AS THEY ARE NOT MOTIONS TO WHICH THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY APPLIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0177 AND FOR THE SAME REASON THEY DO NOT NECESSITATE THE USING UP OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0178 A SENSATION HAS NO MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0179 AND CANNOT BE CONCEIVED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0180 THAT A PARTICULAR MOLECULAR MOTION DOES GIVE RISE TO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXPERIMENTALLY CERTAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0181 BUT THE HOW AND WHY OF THE PROCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0182 ARE JUST AS INEXPLICABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0183 AS IN THE CASE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF KINETIC ENERGY BY IMPACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0184 WHEN DEALING WITH THE DOCTRINE OF THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0185 WE FOUND A CERTAIN RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE OLDEST SPECULATIONS AND THE NEWEST DOCTRINES OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0186 BUT THERE IS NO SUCH RESEMBLANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0187 BETWEEN THE ANCIENT AND MODERN VIEWS OF MOTION AND ITS CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0188 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THE CONCEPTION OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0189 MAY BE REGARDED AS THE MODIFIED DESCENDANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0190 OF THE ARISTOTELIAN CONCEPTION OF FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0191 IN FACT IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT THE ESSENTIAL AND FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0192 LIES IN THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE TRUE LAWS OF STATICS AND DYNAMICS IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0193 AND IN THE INVENTION OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF DEALING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0194 WITH ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LAWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0195 THE ULTIMATE AIM OF MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS THE DEDUCTION OF THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY MATERIAL BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0196 FROM PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL FIRST PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0197 WHETHER THE HUMAN INTELLECT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTAIN THE GOAL SET BEFORE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0198 MAY BE A QUESTION BUT THITHER WILL IT SURELY STRIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0199 THE THIRD GREAT SCIENTIFIC EVENT OF OUR TIME THE REHABILITATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IS PART OF THE SAME TENDENCY OF INCREASING KNOWLEDGE TO UNIFY ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0200 WHICH HAS LED TO THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0201 AND THIS TENDENCY AGAIN IS MAINLY A PRODUCT OF THE INCREASING STRENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0202 CONFERRED BY PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION ON THE BELIEF IN THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0203 OF THAT ORDERLY RELATION OF FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0204 WHICH WE EXPRESS BY THE SO CALLED LAWS OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0205 THE GROWTH OF A PLANT FROM ITS SEED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0206 OF AN ANIMAL FROM ITS EGG THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0207 APPARENT ORIGIN OF INNUMERABLE LIVING THINGS FROM MUD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0208 OR FROM THE PUTREFYING REMAINS OF FORMER ORGANISMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0209 HAS FURNISHED THE EARLIER SCIENTIFIC THINKERS WITH ABUNDANT ANALOGIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0210 SUGGESTIVE OF THE CONCEPTION OF A CORRESPONDING METHOD OF COSMIC EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0211 FROM A FORMLESS CHAOS TO AN ORDERED WORLD WHICH MIGHT EITHER CONTINUE FOR EVER OR UNDERGO DISSOLUTION INTO ITS ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0212 BEFORE STARTING ON A NEW COURSE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0213 IT IS THEREFORE NO WONDER THAT FROM THE DAYS OF THE IONIAN SCHOOL ONWARDS THE VIEW THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS THE RESULT OF SUCH A PROCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0214 SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED ITSELF AS A LEADING DOGMA OF PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0215 THE EMANISTIC THEORIES WHICH PLAYED SO GREAT A PART IN NEOPLATONIC PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0216 AND GNOSTIC THEOLOGY ARE FORMS OF EVOLUTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0217 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DESCARTES PROPOUNDED A SCHEME OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0218 AS AN HYPOTHESIS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MODE OF ORIGIN OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0219 WHILE PROFESSING TO ACCEPT THE ECCLESIASTICAL SCHEME OF CREATION AS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0220 AN ACCOUNT OF THAT WHICH ACTUALLY WAS ITS MANNER OF COMING INTO EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0222 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY KANT PUT FORTH A REMARKABLE SPECULATION AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM CLOSELY SIMILAR TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0223 THAT SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED BY LAPLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0224 AND DESTINED TO BECOME FAMOUS UNDER THE TITLE OF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0225 THE CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS AND THE ACUTE REASONINGS OF THE ITALIAN GEOLOGISTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0226 THE SPECULATIONS OF LEIBNITZ IN THE PROTOGAEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0227 AND OF BUFFON IN HIS THEORIE DE LA TERRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0228 THE SOBER AND PROFOUND REASONINGS OF HUTTON
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0229 IN THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0230 ALL THESE TENDED TO SHOW THAT THE FABRIC OF THE EARTH ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0231 IMPLIED THE CONTINUANCE OF PROCESSES OF NATURAL CAUSATION FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0232 A PERIOD OF TIME AS GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0233 IN RELATION TO HUMAN HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0234 AS THE DISTANCES OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES FROM US ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0235 IN RELATION TO TERRESTRIAL STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0236 ABYSS OF TIME BEGAN TO LOOM AS LARGE AS THE ABYSS OF SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0237 AND THIS REVELATION TO SIGHT AND TOUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0238 OF A LINK HERE AND A LINK THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0239 OF A PRACTICALLY INFINITE CHAIN OF NATURAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0240 PREPARED THE WAY AS PERHAPS NOTHING ELSE HAS DONE FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0241 THE MODERN FORM OF THE ANCIENT THEORY OF EVOLUTION IN THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0242 BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0243 DE MAILLET MADE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO APPLY THE DOCTRINE TO THE LIVING WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0244 IN THE LATTER PART OF IT ERASMUS DARWIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0245 GOETHE TREVIRANUS AND LAMARCK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0246 TOOK UP THE WORK MORE VIGOROUSLY AND WITH BETTER QUALIFICATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0247 THE QUESTION OF SPECIAL CREATION OR EVOLUTION LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIERCE DISPUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0248 WHICH BROKE OUT IN THE FRENCH ACADEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0249 BETWEEN CUVIER AND ST HILAIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0250 AND FOR A TIME THE SUPPORTERS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION WERE SILENCED IF NOT ANSWERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0251 BY THE ALLIANCE OF THE GREATEST NATURALIST OF THE AGE WITH THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL OPPONENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0252 CATASTROPHISM A SHORT SIGHTED TELEOLOGY AND A STILL MORE SHORT SIGHTED ORTHODOXY JOINED FORCES TO CRUSH EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0253 LYELL AND POULETT SCROPE IN THIS COUNTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0254 RESUMED THE WORK OF THE ITALIANS AND OF HUTTON AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0255a THE FORMER AIDED BY A MARVELLOUS POWER OF CLEAR EXPOSITION PLACED UPON AN IRREFRAGABLE BASIS THE TRUTH THAT NATURAL CAUSES ARE COMPETENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0255b TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL EVENTS WHICH CAN BE PROVED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECULAR CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0256 DURING THE DEPOSITION OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0257 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0258 CONSTITUTED AN EPOCH IN GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0259 BUT IT ALSO CONSTITUTED AN EPOCH IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF THE DOCTRINES OF EVOLUTION BY RAISING IN THE MIND OF EVERY INTELLIGENT READER THIS QUESTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0260 IF NATURAL CAUSATION IS COMPETENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NOT LIVING PART OF OUR GLOBE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0261 WHY SHOULD IT NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE LIVING PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0262 BY KEEPING THIS QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS LYELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0263 THOUGH THE KEENEST AND MOST FORMIDABLE OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE TRANSMUTATION THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0264 AS IT WAS FORMULATED BY LAMARCK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0265 WAS OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SERVICE IN FACILITATING THE RECEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0266 OF THE SOUNDER DOCTRINES OF A LATER DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0267 AND IN LIKE FASHION ANOTHER VEHEMENT OPPONENT OF THE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0268 THE ELDER AGASSIZ WAS DOOMED TO HELP THE CAUSE HE HATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0269 AGASSIZ NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0270 OF THE PROGRESSIVE ADVANCE IN ORGANISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0271 OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0272 BUT HE INSISTED UPON THE ANALOGY OF THE STEPS OF THIS PROGRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0273 WITH THOSE BY WHICH THE EMBRYO ADVANCES TO THE ADULT CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0274 AMONG THE HIGHEST FORMS OF EACH GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0275 IN FACT IN ENDEAVORING TO SUPPORT THESE VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0276 HE WENT A GOOD WAY BEYOND THE LIMITS OF ANY CAUTIOUS INTERPRETATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0277 OF THE FACTS THEN KNOWN ALTHOUGH LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0278 WHEWELL SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PARTICULAR PAINS WITH THAT PART OF HIS WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0279 WHICH DEALS WITH THE HISTORY OF GEOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0280 AND SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF HIS SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH BOOKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0281 WHICH COMPRISE THE HISTORY OF PHYSIOLOGY OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0282 AND OF THE PALAETIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0283 VIVIDLY REPRODUCE THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE VICTORIAN EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0284 BUT HERE AS IN THE CASE OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0285 THE HISTORIAN OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES HAS NO PROPHETIC INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0286 NOT EVEN A SUSPICION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0287 OF THAT WHICH THE NEAR FUTURE WAS TO BRING FORTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0288 AND THOSE WHO STILL REPEAT THE ONCE FAVORITE OBJECTION THAT DARWIN'S ORIGIN OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0289 IS NOTHING BUT A NEW VERSION OF THE PHILOSOPHIE ZOOLOGIQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0290 WILL FIND THAT SO LATE AS EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR WHEWELL HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF DARWIN'S MAIN THEOREM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0291 EVEN AS A LOGICAL POSSIBILITY IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0292 THE PUBLICATION OF THAT THEOREM BY DARWIN AND WALLACE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0293 TOOK ALL THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD BY SURPRISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0294 NEITHER THOSE WHO WERE INCLINED TOWARDS THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSMUTATION OR DEVELOPMENT DOCTRINE AS IT WAS THEN CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0295 NOR THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0296 HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0297 THAT THE TENDENCY TO VARIATION IN LIVING BEINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0298 WHICH ALL ADMITTED AS A MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0299 THE SELECTIVE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0300 WHICH NO ONE COULD DENY TO BE A MATTER OF FACT WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0301 AND THE OCCURRENCE OF GREAT GEOLOGICAL CHANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0302 WHICH ALSO WAS MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0303 COULD BE USED AS THE ONLY NECESSARY POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0304 OF A THEORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0305 WHICH EVEN IF NOT AT ONCE COMPETENT TO EXPLAIN ALL THE KNOWN FACTS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE COULD NOT BE SHOWN TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH ANY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0306 SO FAR AS BIOLOGY IS CONCERNED THE PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0307 FOR THE FIRST TIME PUT THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IN ITS APPLICATION TO LIVING THINGS UPON A SOUND SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0308 IT BECAME AN INSTRUMENT OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0309 AND IN NO HANDS DID IT PROVE MORE BRILLIANTLY PROFITABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0310 THAN IN THOSE OF DARWIN HIMSELF HIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0311 PUBLICATIONS ON THE EFFECTS OF DOMESTICATION IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0312 ON THE INFLUENCE OF CROSS FERTILISATION ON FLOWERS AS ORGANS FOR EFFECTING SUCH FERTILISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0313 ON INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS ON THE MOTIONS OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0314 POINTED OUT THE ROUTES OF EXPLORATION WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN FOLLOWED BY HOSTS OF INQUIRERS TO THE GREAT PROFIT OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0315 DARWIN FOUND THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD A MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FIELD FOR EVEN HIS GREAT POWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0316 AND LEFT THE COSMICAL PART OF THE DOCTRINE TO OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0317 NOT MUCH HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0318 SINCE THE TIME OF LAPLACE EXCEPT THAT THE ATTEMPT TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0319 AGAINST THAT HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0320 THAT ALL NEBULAE ARE STAR CLUSTERS HAS BEEN MET BY THE SPECTROSCOPIC PROOF OF THE GASEOUS CONDITION OF SOME OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0322 MOREOVER PHYSICISTS OF THE PRESENT GENERATION APPEAR NOW TO ACCEPT THE SECULAR COOLING OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0323 WHICH IS ONE OF THE COROLLARIES OF THAT HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0324 IN FACT ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE HELP OF DEDUCTIONS FROM THE DATA OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0325 TO LAY DOWN AN APPROXIMATE LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF MILLIONS OF YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE EARTH WAS HABITABLE BY LIVING BEINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0326 IF THE CONCLUSIONS THUS REACHED SHOULD STAND THE TEST OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION THEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0327 WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE VERY VALUABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0328 BUT WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE THEY CAN HAVE NO INFLUENCE UPON THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0329 ITS APPLICATION TO LIVING ORGANISMS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0330 OCCURRENCE OF SUCCESSIVE FORMS OF LIFE UPON OUR GLOBE IS AN HISTORICAL FACT WHICH CANNOT BE DISPUTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0331 AND THE RELATION OF THESE SUCCESSIVE FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0332 AS STAGES OF EVOLUTION OF THE SAME TYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0333 IS ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS CASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0334 THE BIOLOGIST HAS NO MEANS OF DETERMINING THE TIME OVER WHICH THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION HAS EXTENDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0335 BUT ACCEPTS THE COMPUTATION OF THE PHYSICAL GEOLOGIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0336 AND THE PHYSICIST WHATEVER THAT MAY BE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0337 EVOLUTION AS A PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINE APPLICABLE TO ALL PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0338 WHETHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WHETHER MANIFESTED BY MATERIAL ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0339 OR BY MEN IN SOCIETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0340 HAS BEEN DEALT WITH SYSTEMATICALLY IN THE SYNTHETIC PHILOSOPHY OF MR HERBERT SPENCER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0341 COMMENT ON THAT GREAT UNDERTAKING WOULD NOT BE IN PLACE HERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0342 I MENTION IT BECAUSE SO FAR AS I KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0343 IT IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO DEAL ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WITH MODERN SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND SPECULATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0344 FOR THE PHILOSOPHIC POSITIVE OF M COMTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0345 WITH WHICH MR SPENCER'S SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETIMES COMPARED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0346 THOUGH IT PROFESSES A SIMILAR OBJECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0347 IS UNFORTUNATELY PERMEATED BY A THOROUGHLY UNSCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0348 AND ITS AUTHOR HAD NO ADEQUATE ACQUAINTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0349 WITH THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES EVEN OF HIS OWN TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0350 THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION SO FAR AS THE PRESENT PHYSICAL COSMOS IS CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0351 POSTULATES THE FIXITY OF THE RULES OF OPERATION OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION IN THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0352 IF ALL KINDS OF MATTER ARE MODIFICATIONS OF ONE KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0353 AND IF ALL MODES OF MOTION ARE DERIVED FROM THE SAME ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0354 THE ORDERLY EVOLUTION OF PHYSICAL NATURE OUT OF ONE SUBSTRATUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0355 AND ONE ENERGY IMPLIES THAT THE RULES OF ACTION OF THAT ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0356 SHOULD BE FIXED AND DEFINITE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0357 THE PAST HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE BACK TO THAT POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0358 THERE CAN BE NO ROOM FOR CHANCE OR DISORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0359 BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS UNIVERSE OF SIMPLEST MATTER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0360 DEFINITELY OPERATING ENERGY WHICH FORMS OUR HYPOTHETICAL STARTING POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0361 MAY NOT ITSELF BE A PRODUCT OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0362 FROM A UNIVERSE OF SUCH MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0363 IN WHICH THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ENERGY WERE NOT DEFINITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0364 IN WHICH FOR EXAMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0365 OUR LAWS OF MOTION HELD GOOD FOR SOME UNITS AND NOT FOR OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0366 OR FOR THE SAME UNITS AT ONE TIME AND NOT AT ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0367 AND WHICH WOULD THEREFORE BE A REAL EPICUREAN CHANCE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0368 FOR MYSELF I MUST CONFESS THAT I FIND THE AIR OF THIS REGION OF SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0369 TOO RAREFIED FOR MY CONSTITUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0370 AND I AM DISPOSED TO TAKE REFUGE IN IGNORAMUS ET IGNORABIMUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0371 THE EXECUTION OF MY FURTHER TASK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0372 THE INDICATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0373 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0374 IS EMBARRASSED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF THE OBJECTS OF CHOICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0375 AND BY THE DIFFICULTY WHICH EVERYONE BUT A SPECIALIST IN EACH DEPARTMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0376 MUST FIND IN DRAWING A DUE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DISCOVERIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0377 WHICH STRIKE THE IMAGINATION BY THEIR NOVELTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0378 OR BY THEIR PRACTICAL INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0379 AND THOSE UNOBTRUSIVE BUT PREGNANT OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0380 IN WHICH THE GERMS OF THE GREAT THINGS OF THE FUTURE REALLY LIE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0381 MOREOVER MY LIMITS RESTRICT ME TO LITTLE MORE THAN A BARE CHRONICLE OF THE EVENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0382 WHICH I HAVE TO NOTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0383 IN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY THE OLD BOUNDARIES OF WHICH SCIENCES ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING EFFACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0384 ONE CAN HARDLY GO WRONG IN ASCRIBING A PRIMARY VALUE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0385 THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE RELATION BETWEEN THE SOLID LIQUID AND GASEOUS STATES OF MATTER ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0386 AND DEGREES OF PRESSURE AND OF HEAT ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0387 ALMOST ALL EVEN THE MOST REFRACTORY SOLIDS HAVE BEEN VAPORISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0388 BY THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE ELECTRIC ARC AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0389 THE MOST REFRACTORY GASES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ASSUME THE LIQUID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0390 AND EVEN THE SOLID FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0391 BY THE COMBINATION OF HIGH PRESSURE WITH INTENSE COLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0392 IT HAS FURTHER BEEN SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO DISCONTINUITY BETWEEN THESE STATES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0393 THAT A GAS PASSES INTO THE LIQUID STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0394 THROUGH A CONDITION WHICH IS NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0395 AND THAT A LIQUID BODY BECOMES SOLID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0396 OR A SOLID LIQUID BY THE INTERMEDIATION OF A CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0397 IN WHICH IT IS NEITHER TRULY SOLID NOR TRULY LIQUID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0398 THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCURRED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VIEW THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0399 A GAS IS A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0400 THE PARTICLES OF WHICH ARE IN INCESSANT RECTILINEAR MOTION AT HIGH VELOCITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0401 COLLIDING WITH ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0402 AND BOUNDING BACK WHEN THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CONTAINING VESSEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0403 AND ON THIS THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0404 THE ALREADY ASCERTAINED RELATIONS OF GASEOUS BODIES TO HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0405 AND PRESSURE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0406 IMMENSE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTED IN THE MEANS OF EXHAUSTING A GIVEN SPACE OF ITS GASEOUS CONTENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0407 AND EXPERIMENTATION ON THE PHENOMENA WHICH ATTEND THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0408 THE ACTION OF RADIANT HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0409 WITHIN THE EXTREMELY RAREFIED MEDIA THUS PRODUCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0410 HAS YIELDED A GREAT NUMBER OF REMARKABLE RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0411 SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE FAMILIAR TO THE PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0412 BY THE GIESELER TUBES AND THE RADIOMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0413 ALREADY THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE AFFORDED AN UNEXPECTED INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0414 INTO THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THERMAL AND ELECTRIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0415 AND THEY OPEN UP A VAST FIELD FOR FUTURE INQUIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0416 INTO SOME OF THE DEEPEST PROBLEMS OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0417 OTHER IMPORTANT STEPS IN THE SAME DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0418 HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ABSORPTION OF RADIANT HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0419 PROCEEDING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES BY SOLID FLUID AND GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0420 AND IT IS A CURIOUS EXAMPLE OF THE INTERCONNECTION OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0421 THAT SOME OF THE RESULTS THUS OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0422 HAVE PROVED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN METEOROLOGY THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0423 EXISTENCE OF NUMEROUS DARK LINES CONSTANT IN THEIR NUMBER AND POSITION IN THE VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0424 WAS MADE OUT BY FRAUNHOFER IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0425 BUT MORE THAN FORTY YEARS ELAPSED BEFORE THEIR CAUSES WERE ASCERTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0426 AND THEIR IMPORTANCE RECOGNISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0427 SPECTROSCOPY WHICH THEN TOOK ITS RISE IS PROBABLY THAT EMPLOYMENT OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0428 ALREADY WON AS A MEANS OF FURTHER ACQUISITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0429 WHICH MOST IMPRESSES THE IMAGINATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0430 FOR IT HAS SUDDENLY AND IMMENSELY ENLARGED OUR POWER OF OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0431 WHICH ALMOST INFINITE MINUTENESS ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0432 AND ALMOST INFINITE DISTANCE ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0433 HAVE HITHERTO OPPOSED TO THE RECOGNITION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0434 THE PRESENCE AND THE CONDITION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0435 ONE EIGHTEEN MILLIONTH OF A GRAIN OF SODIUM IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRIT LAMP
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0436 MAY BE DETECTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME IT GIVES TRUST WORTHY INDICATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0437 OF THE MATERIAL CONSTITUTION NOT ONLY OF THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0438 BUT OF THE FARTHEST OF THOSE FIXED STARS AND NEBULAE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0439 WHICH AFFORD SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO AFFECT THE EYE OR

knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0441 THE MATHEMATICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ELUCIDATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTRICITY AND THE STUDY OF THE RELATIONS OF THIS FORM OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0442 WITH CHEMICAL AND THERMAL ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0443 HAD MADE EXTENSIVE PROGRESS BEFORE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0444 BUT THE DETERMINATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF MAGNETISM ON LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0445 THE DISCOVERY OF DIAMAGNETISM OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0446 THE INFLUENCE OF CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE ON MAGNETISM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0447 THE COMPLETION OF THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0448 ALL BELONG TO THE PRESENT EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0449 TO IT ALSO APPERTAIN THE PRACTICAL EXECUTION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0450 THE WORKING OUT OF THE RESULTS OF THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0451 OBSERVATIONS ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM SUGGESTED BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0452 HUMBOLDT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0453 AND THE INVENTION OF INSTRUMENTS OF INFINITE DELICACY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0454 AND PRECISION FOR THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0455 THE VOLTAIC BATTERY HAS RECEIVED VAST IMPROVEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0456 WHILE THE INVENTION OF MAGNETO ELECTRIC ENGINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0457 AND OF IMPROVED MEANS OF PRODUCING ORDINARY ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0458 HAS PROVIDED SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0459 VASTLY SUPERIOR TO ANY BEFORE EXTANT IN POWER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0460 AND FAR MORE CONVENIENT FOR USE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0461 IS PERHAPS THIS BRANCH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE WHICH MAY CLAIM THE PALM FOR ITS PRACTICAL FRUITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0462 NO LESS THAN FOR THE AID WHICH IT HAS FURNISHED TO THE INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0463 OF OTHER PARTS OF THE FIELD OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0464 THE IDEA OF THE PRACTICABILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DISTANT POINTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0465 BY MEANS OF ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0466 COULD HARDLY FAIL TO HAVE SIMMERED IN THE MINDS OF INGENIOUS MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0467 SINCE WELL NIGH A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0468 EXPERIMENTAL PROOF WAS GIVEN THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0469 ELECTRIC DISTURBANCES COULD BE PROPAGATED THROUGH A WIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0470 TWELVE THOUSAND FEET LONG VARIOUS METHODS OF CARRYING THE SUGGESTION INTO PRACTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0471 HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0472 BUT THE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHY WHICH AT THE PRESENT TIME BRINGS ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0473 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF ONE ANOTHER

knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0476 THIS INVENTION TAKES ITS PLACE BESIDE THAT OF GUNPOWDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0477 WHICH TENDED TO ABOLISH THE PHYSICAL INEQUALITIES OF FIGHTING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0478 OF PRINTING WHICH TENDED TO DESTROY THE EFFECT OF INEQUALITIES

knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0485 WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF PROGRESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0486 WHICH HAS REDEEMED EUROPE FROM BARBARISM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0487 AGAINST WHICH ONE IS GLAD TO THINK THAT THOSE WHO IN OUR TIME ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0488 EMPLOYING THEMSELVES IN FANNING THE EMBERS OF ANCIENT WRONG
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0489 IN SETTING CLASS AGAINST CLASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0490 AND IN TRYING TO TEAR ASUNDER THE EXISTING BONDS OF UNITY ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0491 UNDERTAKING A FUTILE STRUGGLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0492 THE TELEPHONE IS ONLY SECOND IN PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0493 INVENTED AS IT WERE ONLY THE OTHER DAY IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0494 HAS ALREADY TAKEN ITS PLACE AS AN APPLIANCE OF DAILY LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0495 SIXTY YEARS AGO THE EXTRACTION OF METALS FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0496 BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WAS SIMPLY A HIGHLY INTERESTING SCIENTIFIC FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0497 AT THE PRESENT DAY THE GALVANO PLASTIC ART IS A GREAT INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0498 AND IN COMBINATION WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0499 PROMISES TO BE OF ENDLESS SERVICE IN THE ARTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0500 ELECTRIC LIGHTING IS ANOTHER GREAT GIFT OF SCIENCE TO CIVILISATION THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0501 PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0502 LARGELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS COST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0503 BUT THOSE WHOSE MEMORIES GO BACK TO THE TINDER BOX PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0504 AND RECOLLECT THE COST OF THE FIRST LUCIFER MATCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0505 WILL NOT DESPAIR OF THE RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0506 OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENCE AND INGENUITY TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0507 THE CHEAP PRODUCTION OF ANYTHING FOR WHICH THERE IS A LARGE DEMAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0508 END OF SECTION THREE THIS HAS BEEN A LIBRIVOX RECORDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv/wav/adv0509 ALL LIBRIVOX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0001 SECTION FOUR OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY THE INFLUENCE OF THE PROGRESS OF ELECTRICAL KNOWLEDGE AND INVENTION UPON THAT OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0003 IN OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE IS HIGHLY REMARKABLE THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL WITH MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0004 HAS PRODUCED INSTRUMENTS BY WHICH NOT ONLY MAY EXTREMELY SMALL INTERVALS OF TIME BE EXACTLY MEASURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0005 BUT THE VARYING RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENTS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN SUCH INTERVALS AND APPEAR TO THE ORDINARY SENSE INSTANTANEOUS IS RECORDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0006 THE DURATION OF THE WINKING OF AN EYE IS A PROVERBIAL EXPRESSION FOR AN INSTANTANEOUS ACTION BUT BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0007 THE HELP OF THE REVOLVING CYLINDER AND THE ELECTRICAL MARKING APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0008 IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A GRAPHIC RECORD OF SUCH AN ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0009 IN WHICH IF IT ENDURES A SECOND THAT SECOND SHALL BE SUBDIVIDED INTO A HUNDRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0010 OR A THOUSAND EQUAL PARTS AND THE STATE OF THE ACTION AT EACH HUNDREDTH OR THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND EXHIBITED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0011 IN FACT THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE SAID TO BE TIME MICROSCOPES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0012 SUCH APPLIANCES HAVE NOT ONLY EFFECTED A REVOLUTION IN PHYSIOLOGY BY THE POWER OF ANALYSING THE PHENOMENA OF MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ACTIVITY WHICH THEY HAVE CONFERRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0013 BUT THEY HAVE FURNISHED NEW METHODS OF MEASURING THE RATE OF MOVEMENT OF PROJECTILES TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0014 THE ARTILLERIST AGAIN THE MICROPHONE WHICH RENDERS THE MINUTEST MOVEMENTS AUDIBLE AND WHICH ENABLES A LISTENER TO HEAR THE FOOTFALL OF A FLY HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0015 EQUIPPED THE SENSE OF HEARING WITH THE MEANS OF ENTERING ALMOST AS DEEPLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0016 INTO THE PENETRALIA OF NATURE AS DOES THE SENSE OF SIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0017 THAT LIGHT EXERTS A REMARKABLE INFLUENCE IN BRINGING ABOUT CERTAIN CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS AND DECOMPOSITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0018 WAS WELL KNOWN FIFTY YEARS AGO AND VARIOUS MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE PERMANENT PICTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0019 BY THE HELP OF THAT KNOWLEDGE HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0020 IT WAS NOT TILL EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE HOWEVER THAT PRACTICAL SUCCESS WAS OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0021 BUT THE DAGUERREOTYPES WERE BOTH CUMBROUS AND COSTLY AND PHOTOGRAPHY WOULD NEVER HAVE ATTAINED ITS PRESENT IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0022 HAD NOT THE PROGRESS OF INVENTION SUBSTITUTED PAPER AND GLASS FOR THE SILVERED PLATES THEN IN USE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0023 IT IS NOT MY AFFAIR TO DWELL UPON THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0024 DAY BUT IT IS GERMANE TO MY PURPOSE TO REMARK THAT IT HAS FURNISHED A MOST VALUABLE ACCESSORY TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0025 THE METHODS OF RECORDING MOTIONS AND LAPSE OF TIME ALREADY IN EXISTENCE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0026 THE HANDS OF THE ASTRONOMER AND THE METEOROLOGIST IT HAS YIELDED MEANS OF REGISTERING TERRESTRIAL SOLAR PLANETARY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0027 AND STELLAR PHENOMENA INDEPENDENT OF THE SOURCES OF ERROR ATTENDANT ON ORDINARY OBSERVATION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0028 THE HANDS OF THE PHYSICIST NOT ONLY DOES IT RECORD SPECTROSCOPIC PHENOMENA WITH UNSURPASSABLE EASE AND PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0029 BUT IT HAS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF RAYS HAVING POWERFUL CHEMICAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0030 OR BEYOND THE VISIBLE LIMITS OF EITHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WHILE TO THE NATURALIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0031 IT FURNISHES THE MEANS BY WHICH THE FORMS OF MANY HIGHLY COMPLICATED OBJECTS MAY BE REPRESENTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0032 WITHOUT THAT POSSIBILITY OF ERROR WHICH IS INHERENT IN THE WORK OF THE DRAUGHTSMAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0033 IN FACT IN MANY CASES THE STERN IMPARTIALITY OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN OBJECTION TO ITS EMPLOYMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0034 IT MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE IMPORTANT AND THE UNIMPORTANT AND HENCE PHOTOGRAPHS OF DISSECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0035 ARE RARELY SO USEFUL AS THE WORK OF A DRAUGHTSMAN WHO IS AT ONCE ACCURATE AND INTELLIGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0036 THE DETERMINATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF A NEW PLANET NEPTUNE FAR BEYOND THE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN BOUNDS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0037 BY MATHEMATICAL DEDUCTION FROM THE FACTS OF PERTURBATION AND THE IMMEDIATE CONFIRMATION OF THAT DETERMINATION IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0038 BY OBSERVERS WHO TURNED THEIR TELESCOPES INTO THE PART OF THE HEAVENS INDICATED AS ITS PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0039 CONSTITUTE A REMARKABLE TESTIMONY OF NATURE TO THE VALIDITY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ASTRONOMY OF OUR TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0040 IN ADDITION SO MANY NEW ASTEROIDS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THOSE WHICH WERE ALREADY KNOWN TO CIRCULATE IN THE PLACE WHICH THEORETICALLY SHOULD BE OCCUPIED BY A PLANET
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0041 BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER THAT THEIR NUMBER NOW AMOUNTS TO BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0042 I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE EXTENSION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0043 BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF SPECTROSCOPY IT HAS NOT ONLY THROWN WONDERFUL LIGHT UPON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0044 FIXED STARS AND NEBULAE AND COMETS BUT IT HOLDS OUT A PROSPECT OF OBTAINING DEFINITE EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0045 AS TO THE NATURE OF OUR SO CALLED ELEMENTARY BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0046 THE APPLICATION OF THE GENERALISATIONS OF THERMOTICS TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DURATION OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0047 AND OF DEDUCTIONS FROM TIDAL PHENOMENA TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0048 AND OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OF THE MOON IN PAST EPOCHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0049 OF THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMPETENCY OF THE GREAT SECULAR CHANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0050 KNOWN UNDER THE GENERAL NAME OF THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES TO CAUSE CORRESPONDING MODIFICATIONS IN THE CLIMATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0051 OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF OUR GLOBE HAVE BROUGHT ASTRONOMY INTO INTIMATE RELATION WITH GEOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0052 GEOLOGY IN FACT PROVES THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST HISTORY OF THE EARTH THE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE SAME REGION HAVE BEEN WIDELY DIFFERENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0053 AND SEEKS THE EXPLANATION OF THIS IMPORTANT TRUTH FROM THE SISTER SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0054 THE FACTS THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TERTIARY EPOCH EVERGREEN TREES ABOUNDED WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0055 AND THAT IN THE LONG SUBSEQUENT QUATERNARY EPOCH AN ARCTIC CLIMATE WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENT OF GIGANTIC GLACIERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0056 OBTAINED IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AS FAR SOUTH AS SWITZERLAND AND CENTRAL FRANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0057 ARE AS WELL ESTABLISHED AS ANY TRUTHS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0058 BUT WHETHER THE EXPLANATION OF THESE EXTREME VARIATIONS IN THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF A GREAT PART OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0059 IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE CONCOMITANT CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AND WATER SURFACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0060 OF WHICH GEOLOGY AFFORDS EVIDENCE OR IN ASTRONOMICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS THOSE TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0061 IS A QUESTION WHICH MUST AWAIT ITS ANSWER FROM THE SCIENCE OF THE FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0062 TURNING NOW TO THE GREAT STEPS IN THAT PROGRESS WHICH THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES HAVE MADE SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0063 WE ARE MET ON THE THRESHOLD OF OUR EPOCH WITH PERHAPS THE GREATEST OF ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0064 NAMELY THE PROMULGATION BY SCHWANN IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE OF THE GENERALISATION KNOWN AS THE CELL THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0065 THE APPLICATION AND EXTENSION OF WHICH BY A HOST OF SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATORS HAS REVOLUTIONISED MORPHOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0066 DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY THANKS TO THE IMMENSE SERIES OF LABORS THUS INAUGURATED THE FOLLOWING FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0067 ALL LIVING BODIES CONTAIN SUBSTANCES OF CLOSELY SIMILAR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0068 WHICH CONSTITUTE THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF LIFE KNOWN AS PROTOPLASM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0069 SO FAR AS OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE GOES THIS TAKES ITS ORIGIN ONLY FROM PRE EXISTING PROTOPLASM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0070 ALL COMPLEX LIVING BODIES CONSIST AT ONE PERIOD OF THEIR EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0071 OF AN AGGREGATE OF MINUTE PORTIONS OF SUCH SUBSTANCE OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE CALLED CELLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0072 EACH CELL HAVING ITS OWN LIFE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHERS THOUGH INFLUENCED BY THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0073 ALL THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE THE RESULTS OF THE MODE OF MULTIPLICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0074 GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL METAMORPHOSIS OF THESE CELLS CONSIDERED AS MORPHOLOGICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0075 ALL THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ASSIMILATION SECRETION EXCRETION MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0076 GENERATION ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CELLS CONSIDERED AS PHYSIOLOGICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0077 EACH INDIVIDUAL AMONG THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS IS A SYNTHESIS OF MILLIONS OF SUBORDINATE INDIVIDUALITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0078 ITS INDIVIDUALITY THEREFORE IS THAT OF A CIVITAS IN THE ANCIENT SENSE OR THAT OF THE LEVIATHAN OF HOBBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0079 THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0080 THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND THE MODES OF CHANGE IN THE CELLS OF THE TWO ARE FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0081 MOREOVER THE HIGHER FORMS ARE EVOLVED FROM LOWER IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0082 BY ANALOGOUS PROCESSES OF DIFFERENTIATION COALESCENCE AND REDUCTION IN BOTH THE VEGETABLE AND THE ANIMAL WORLDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0083 AT THE PRESENT TIME THE CELL THEORY IN CONSEQUENCE OF RECENT INVESTIGATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0084 INTO THE STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHOSIS OF THE NUCLEUS IS UNDERGOING A NEW DEVELOPMENT OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0085 WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS FORESHADOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0086 OF A PHYSICAL THEORY OF HEREDITY ON A SAFER FOUNDATION THAN THOSE WHICH BUFFON AND DARWIN HAVE DEVISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0087 THE POPULAR BELIEF IN ABIOGENESIS OR THE SO CALLED SPONTANEOUS GENERATION OF THE LOWER FORMS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0088 WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ANTIQUITY HELD ITS GROUND DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0089 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FREQUENT CITATION OF THE PHRASE WRONGFULLY ATTRIBUTED TO HARVEY OMNE VIVUM EX OVO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0090 THAT GREAT PHYSIOLOGIST BELIEVED IN SPONTANEOUS GENERATION AS FIRMLY AS ARISTOTLE DID
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0091 AND IT WAS ONLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT REDI
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0092 BY SIMPLE AND WELL DEVISED EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0093 IN A GREAT NUMBER OF CASES OF SUPPOSED SPONTANEOUS GENERATION THE ANIMALS WHICH MADE THEIR APPEARANCE OWED THEIR ORIGIN TO THE ORDINARY PROCESS OF REPRODUCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0094 AND THUS SHOOK THE ANCIENT DOCTRINE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0095 THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS REVIVED IN A NEW FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0096 BY NEEDHAM AND BUFFON BUT THE EXPERIMENTS OF SPALLANZANI ENFORCED THE CONCLUSIONS OF REDI
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0097 AND COMPELLED THE ADVOCATES OF THE OCCURRENCE OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION TO SEEK EVIDENCE FOR THEIR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0098 ONLY AMONG THE PARASITES AND THE LOWEST AND MINUTEST ORGANISMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0099 IT IS JUST FIFTY YEARS SINCE SCHWANN AND OTHERS PROVED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0100 EVEN WITH RESPECT TO THEM THE SUPPOSED EVIDENCE OF ABIOGENESIS WAS UNTRUSTWORTHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0101 DURING THE PRESENT EPOCH THE QUESTION WHETHER LIVING MATTER CAN BE PRODUCED IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN BY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0102 OF OTHER LIVING MATTER HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AFRESH WITH GREAT VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0103 AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED BY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS OF A PRECISION AND REFINEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0104 UNKNOWN TO PREVIOUS INVESTIGATORS THE RESULT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF ABIOGENESIS HAS UTTERLY BROKEN DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0105 IN EVERY CASE WHICH HAS BEEN PROPERLY TESTED SO FAR AS THE LOWEST AND MINUTEST ORGANISMS ARE CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0106 IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THEY NEVER MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IF THOSE PRECAUTIONS BY WHICH THEIR GERMS ARE CERTAINLY EXCLUDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0107 ARE TAKEN AND IN REGARD TO PARASITES EVERY CASE WHICH SEEMED TO MAKE FOR THEIR GENERATION FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ANIMAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0108 OR PLANT WHICH THEY INFEST HAS BEEN PROVED TO HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0109 WHETHER NOT LIVING MATTER MAY PASS OR EVER HAS UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0110 PASSED INTO LIVING MATTER WITHOUT THE AGENCY OF PRE EXISTING LIVING MATTER NECESSARILY REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0111 ALL THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERGO THIS METAMORPHOSIS UNDER ANY KNOWN CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0112 THOSE WHO TAKE A MONISTIC VIEW OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD MAY FAIRLY HOLD ABIOGENESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0113 AS A PIOUS OPINION SUPPORTED BY ANALOGY AND DEFENDED BY OUR IGNORANCE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0114 AS MATTERS STAND IT IS EQUALLY JUSTIFIABLE TO REGARD THE PHYSICAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0115 AS A SORT OF DUAL MONARCHY THE KINGDOMS OF LIVING MATTER AND OF NOT LIVING MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0116 ARE UNDER ONE SYSTEM OF LAWS AND THERE IS A PERFECT FREEDOM OF EXCHANGE AND TRANSIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0117 BUT NO CLAIM TO BIOLOGICAL NATIONALITY IS VALID EXCEPT BIRTH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0118 A HOST OF ACCURATE AND PATIENT INQUIRERS AIDED BY NOVEL METHODS OF PREPARATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0119 WHICH ENABLE THE ANATOMIST TO EXHAUST THE DETAILS OF VISIBLE STRUCTURE AND TO REPRODUCE THEM WITH GEOMETRICAL PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0120 HAVE INVESTIGATED EVERY IMPORTANT GROUP OF LIVING ANIMALS AND PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0121 NO LESS THAN THE FOSSIL RELICS OF FORMER FAUNAE AND FLORAE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0122 AN ENORMOUS ADDITION HAS THUS BEEN MADE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ESPECIALLY OF THE LOWER FORMS OF LIFE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0123 IT MAY BE SAID THAT MORPHOLOGY HOWEVER INEXHAUSTIBLE IN DETAIL IS COMPLETE IN ITS BROAD FEATURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0124 CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS MERELY A CONVENIENT SUMMARY EXPRESSION OF MORPHOLOGICAL FACTS HAS UNDERGONE A CORRESPONDING IMPROVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0125 THE BREAKS WHICH FORMERLY SEPARATED OUR GROUPS FROM ONE ANOTHER AS ANIMALS FROM PLANTS VERTEBRATES FROM INVERTEBRATES CRYPTOGAMS FROM PHANEROGAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0126 HAVE EITHER BEEN FILLED UP OR SHOWN TO HAVE NO THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0127 THE QUESTION OF THE POSITION OF MAN AS AN ANIMAL HAS GIVEN RISE TO MUCH DISPUTATION WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0128 THE RESULT OF PROVING THAT THERE IS NO ANATOMICAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL CHARACTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0129 BY WHICH HE IS MORE WIDELY DISTINGUISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0130 FROM THE GROUP OF ANIMALS MOST NEARLY ALLIED TO HIM THAN THEY ARE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0131 IN FACT IN THIS PARTICULAR THE CLASSIFICATION OF LINNAEUS HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACTS THAN THOSE OF MOST OF HIS SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0132 THE STUDY OF MAN AS A GENUS AND SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0133 CONDUCTED WITH REFERENCE TO NO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAN THOSE WHICH WOULD BE ADMITTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0134 OF ANY OTHER FORM OF ANIMAL LIFE HAS GIVEN RISE TO A SPECIAL BRANCH OF BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0135 KNOWN AS ANTHROPOLOGY WHICH HAS GROWN WITH GREAT RAPIDITY NUMEROUS SOCIETIES DEVOTED TO THIS PORTION OF SCIENCE HAVE SPRUNG UP
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0136 AND THE ENERGY OF ITS DEVOTEES HAS PRODUCED A COPIOUS LITERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0137 THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE VARIOUS RACES OF MEN HAVE BEEN STUDIED WITH A MINUTENESS AND ACCURACY HERETOFORE UNKNOWN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0138 DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF HUMAN CONTEMPORARIES OF THE EXTINCT ANIMALS OF THE LATEST GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0139 HAS BEEN OBTAINED PHYSICAL SCIENCE HAS THUS BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CLOSEST RELATION WITH HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0140 AND WITH ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS WHICH DURING OUR TIME HAVE PUT BEYOND DOUBT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0141 THE VAST ANTIQUITY OF BABYLONIAN AND EGYPTIAN CIVILISATION ARE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF ANTHROPOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0142 AS TO THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IS A LOGICAL PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS IN PUTTING TOGETHER THOSE THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0143 WHICH ARE LIKE AND KEEPING ASUNDER THOSE WHICH ARE UNLIKE AND A MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF COURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0144 TAKES NOTES ONLY OF MORPHOLOGICAL LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0145 SO LONG THEREFORE AS OUR MORPHOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS ALMOST WHOLLY CONFINED TO ANATOMY THE CHARACTERS OF GROUPS WERE SOLELY ANATOMICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0146 BUT AS THE PHENOMENA OF EMBRYOLOGY WERE EXPLORED THE LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT HAD TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0147 AND AT PRESENT THE STUDY OF ANCESTRAL EVOLUTION INTRODUCES A NEW ELEMENT OF LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0148 WHICH IS NOT ONLY EMINENTLY DESERVING OF RECOGNITION BUT MUST ULTIMATELY PREDOMINATE OVER ALL OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0149 A CLASSIFICATION WHICH SHALL REPRESENT THE PROCESS OF ANCESTRAL EVOLUTION IS IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0150 THE END WHICH THE LABORS OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TAXONOMIST MUST KEEP IN VIEW
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0151 BUT IT IS AN END WHICH CANNOT BE ATTAINED UNTIL THE PROGRESS OF PALAEONTOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0152 HAS GIVEN US FAR MORE INSIGHT THAN WE YET POSSESS INTO THE HISTORICAL FACTS OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0153 MUCH OF THE SPECULATIVE PHYLOGENY WHICH ABOUNDS AMONG MY PRESENT CONTEMPORARIES REMINDS ME VERY FORCIBLY OF THE SPECULATIVE MORPHOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0154 UNCHECKED BY A KNOWLEDGE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS RIFE IN MY YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0155 AS HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTING INQUIRY IN THIS OR THAT DIRECTION IT IS OFTEN EXTREMELY USEFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0156 BUT WHEN THE PRODUCT OF SUCH SPECULATION IS PLACED ON A LEVEL WITH THOSE GENERALISATIONS OF MORPHOLOGICAL TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0157 WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY THE DEFINITIONS OF NATURAL GROUPS IT TENDS TO CONFUSE FANCY WITH FACT AND TO CREATE MERE CONFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0158 WE ARE IN DANGER OF DRIFTING INTO A NEW NATUR PHILOSOPHIE WORSE THAN THE OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0159 BECAUSE THERE IS LESS EXCUSE FOR IT BOYLE DID GREAT SERVICE TO SCIENCE BY HIS SCEPTICAL CHEMIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0160 AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT DAY A SCEPTICAL BIOLOGIST MIGHT EXERT AN EQUALLY BENEFICENT INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0161 WHOSO WISHES TO GAIN A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE PROGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGY SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0162 WILL DO WELL TO COMPARE MUELLER'S PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0163 WHICH APPEARED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND DRAPIEZ EDITION OF RICHARD'S NOUVEAUX ELEMENTS DE BOTANIQUE PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0164 WITH ANY OF THE PRESENT HANDBOOKS OF ANIMALS AND VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY MUELLER'S WORK WAS A MASTERPIECE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0165 UNSURPASSED SINCE THE TIME OF HALLER AND RICHARD'S BOOK ENJOYED A GREAT REPUTATION AT THE TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0166 BUT THEIR SUCCESSORS TRANSPORT ONE INTO A NEW WORLD THAT WHICH CHARACTERISES THE NEW PHYSIOLOGY IS THAT IT IS PERMEATED BY AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0167 INDEED BASED UPON CONCEPTIONS WHICH THOUGH NOT WHOLLY ABSENT ARE BUT DAWNING ON THE MINDS OF THE OLDER WRITERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0168 MODERN PHYSIOLOGY SETS FORTH AS ITS CHIEF ENDS FIRSTLY THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE FACTS AND CONDITIONS OF CELL LIFE IN GENERAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0169 SECONDLY IN COMPOSITE ORGANISMS THE ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONS OF ORGANS INTO THOSE OF THE CELLS OF WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0170 THIRDLY THE EXPLICATION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH THIS LOCAL CELL LIFE IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0171 CONTROLLED AND BROUGHT INTO RELATION WITH THE LIFE OF THE REST OF THE CELLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0172 WHICH COMPOSE THE ORGANISM FOURTHLY THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF LIFE IN GENERAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0173 ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE LIVING BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0174 ARE OF THE SAME ORDER AS THOSE WHICH TAKE PLACE OUT OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0175 AND THAT WHATEVER ENERGY IS EXERTED IN PRODUCING SUCH PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0176 IS DERIVED FROM THE COMMON STOCK OF ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0177 THE FIFTH PLACE MODERN PHYSIOLOGY INVESTIGATES THE RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0178 THE ASSUMPTION THAT MOLECULAR CHANGES IN DEFINITE PORTIONS OF NERVOUS MATTER STAND IN THE RELATION OF NECESSARY ANTECEDENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0179 TO DEFINITE MENTAL STATES AND OPERATIONS THE WORK WHICH HAS BEEN DONE IN EACH OF THE DIRECTIONS HERE INDICATED IS VAST AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0180 THE ACCUMULATION OF SOLID KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTED IS CORRESPONDINGLY GREAT FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0181 THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE PHYSIOLOGISTS ARE NOW IN THE POSITION TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT CLEAR AND DISTINCT THOUGH BY NO MEANS COMPLETE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0182 CONCEPTIONS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GREAT FUNCTIONS OF ASSIMILATION RESPIRATION SECRETION DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0183 REMOVAL OF WASTE PRODUCTS MOTION SENSATION AND REPRODUCTION ARE PERFORMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0184 WHILE THE OPERATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AS A REGULATIVE APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0185 WHICH INFLUENCES THE ORIGINATION AND THE TRANSMISSION OF MANIFESTATIONS OF ACTIVITY EITHER WITHIN ITSELF OR IN OTHER ORGANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0186 HAS BEEN LARGELY ELUCIDATED I HAVE POINTED OUT IN AN EARLIER PART OF THIS CHAPTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0187 THAT THE HISTORY OF ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE PROVES THAT THEY MUST ATTAIN A CONSIDERABLE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0188 BEFORE THEY YIELD PRACTICAL FRUITS AND THIS IS EMINENTLY TRUE OF PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0189 IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE PRESENT EPOCH THAT PHYSIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0190 HAVE REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH THEY COULD OFFER A SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION TO AGRICULTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0191 AND IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE PRESENT EPOCH THAT ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0192 HAVE YIELDED ANY VERY GREAT AID TO PATHOLOGY AND HYGIENE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0193 WITHIN THAT TIME THEY HAVE ALREADY RENDERED HIGHLY IMPORTANT SERVICES BY THE EXPLORATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF PARASITISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0194 NOT ONLY HAVE THE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL PARASITES SUCH AS THE TAPEWORMS AND THE TRICHINA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0195 WHICH INFEST MEN AND ANIMALS WITH DEADLY RESULTS BEEN CLEARED UP BY MEANS OF EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0196 AND EFFICIENT MODES OF PREVENTION DEDUCED FROM THE DATA SO OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0197 BUT THE TERRIBLE AGENCY OF THE PARASITIC FUNGI AND OF THE INFINITESIMALLY MINUTE MICROBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0198 WHICH WORK FAR GREATER HAVOC AMONG PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0199 THE PARTICULATE OR GERM THEORY OF DISEASE AS IT IS CALLED LONG SINCE SUGGESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0200 HAS OBTAINED A FIRM FOUNDATION IN SO FAR AS IT HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE TRUE IN RESPECT OF SUNDRY EPIDEMIC DISORDERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0201 MOREOVER IT HAS THEORETICALLY JUSTIFIED PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES SUCH AS VACCINATION WHICH FORMERLY RESTED ON A MERELY EMPIRICAL BASIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0202 AND IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO OTHER DISEASES WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0203 FURTHER JUST AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSE OF SCABIES PROVED THE ABSURDITY OF MANY OF THE OLD PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0204 AND TREATMENT OF THAT DISEASE SO THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSE OF SPLENIC FEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0205 AND OTHER SUCH MALADIES HAS GIVEN A NEW DIRECTION TO PROPHYLACTIC AND CURATIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE WORST SCOURGES OF HUMANITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0206 UNLESS THE FANATICISM OF PHILOZOIC SENTIMENT OVERPOWERS THE VOICE OF PHILANTHROPY AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0207 THE LOVE OF DOGS AND CATS SUPERSEDES THAT OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0208 PROGRESS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY WILL INDUBITABLY IN COURSE OF TIME PLACE MEDICINE AND HYGIENE UPON A RATIONAL BASIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0209 TWO CENTURIES AGO ENGLAND WAS DEVASTATED BY THE PLAGUE CLEANLINESS AND COMMON SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0210 WERE ENOUGH TO FREE US FROM ITS RAVAGES ONE CENTURY SINCE SMALL POX WAS ALMOST AS GREAT A SCOURGE SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0211 THOUGH WORKING EMPIRICALLY AND ALMOST IN THE DARK HAS REDUCED THAT EVIL TO RELATIVE INSIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0212 AT THE PRESENT TIME SCIENCE WORKING IN THE LIGHT OF CLEAR KNOWLEDGE HAS ATTACKED SPLENIC FEVER AND HAS BEATEN IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0213 IT IS ATTACKING HYDROPHOBIA WITH NO MEAN PROMISE OF SUCCESS SOONER OR LATER IT WILL DEAL IN THE SAME WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0214 WITH DIPHTHERIA TYPHOID AND SCARLET FEVER TO ONE WHO HAS SEEN HALF A STREET SWEPT CLEAR OF ITS CHILDREN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0215 OR HAS LOST HIS OWN BY THESE HORRIBLE PESTILENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0216 PASSING ONE'S OFFSPRING THROUGH THE FIRE TO MOLOCH SEEMS HUMANITY COMPARED WITH THE PROPOSAL TO DEPRIVE THEM OF HALF THEIR CHANCES OF HEALTH AND LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0217 BECAUSE OF THE DISCOMFORT TO DOGS AND CATS RABBITS AND FROGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0218 WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE SEARCH FOR MEANS OF GUARDING THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0219 AN IMMENSE EXTENSION HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0220 AND THE ELUCIDATION OF THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THAT DISTRIBUTION HAS BEEN GREATLY ADVANCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0221 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS BY ALL CIVILISED NATIONS HAS FURNISHED A SOLID FOUNDATION TO CLIMATOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0222 WHILE A GROWING SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0223 AFFORDS A WHOLESOME CHECK TO THE TENDENCY TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON DISTRIBUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0224 EXPEDITIONS SUCH AS THAT OF THE CHALLENGER EQUIPPED NOT FOR GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THROWING LIGHT ON PROBLEMS OF PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0225 HAVE BEEN SENT OUT BY OUR OWN AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND HAVE OBTAINED STORES OF INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0226 FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE IN POSSESSION OF SOMETHING LIKE PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE DEEP SEAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0227 AND OF THE LIVING POPULATION OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0228 THE CAREFUL AND EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENA PRESENTED BY THE ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW AND ICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0229 IN POLAR AND MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN OUR TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0230 HAS NOT ONLY REVEALED TO THE GEOLOGIST AN AGENT OF DENUDATION AND TRANSPORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0231 WHICH HAS SLOWLY AND QUIETLY PRODUCED EFFECTS FORMERLY CONFIDENTLY REFERRED TO DILUVIAL CATASTROPHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0232 BUT IT HAS SUGGESTED NEW METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR VARIOUS PUZZLING FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0233 PALAEONTOLOGY WHICH TREATS OF THE EXTINCT FORMS OF LIFE AND THEIR SUCCESSION AND DISTRIBUTION UPON OUR GLOBE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0234 A BRANCH OF SCIENCE WHICH COULD HARDLY BE SAID TO EXIST A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0235 HAS UNDERGONE A WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENT IN OUR EPOCH IN SOME GROUPS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS THE EXTINCT REPRESENTATIVES ALREADY KNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0236 ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND IMPORTANT THAN THE LIVING THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE EXISTING FAUNA AND FLORA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0237 IS BUT THE LAST TERM OF A LONG SERIES OF EQUALLY NUMEROUS CONTEMPORARY SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0238 WHICH HAVE SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER BY THE SLOW AND GRADUAL SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIES FOR SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0239 IN THE VAST INTERVAL OF TIME WHICH HAS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEPOSITION OF THE EARLIEST FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0240 AND THE PRESENT DAY THERE IS NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR BELIEVING THAT THE OLDEST REMAINS YET OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0241 CARRY US EVEN NEAR THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE THE IMPRESSIVE WARNINGS OF LYELL AGAINST HASTY SPECULATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0242 BASED UPON NEGATIVE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN FULLY JUSTIFIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0243 TIME AFTER TIME HIGHLY ORGANISED TYPES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN FORMATIONS OF AN AGE IN WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FORMS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0244 HAD BEEN CONFIDENTLY DECLARED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THE WESTERN TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0245 HAVE YIELDED A WORLD OF EXTINCT ANIMAL FORMS UNDREAMED OF FIFTY YEARS AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0246 AND WHEREVER SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS SERIES OF THE REMAINS OF ANY GIVEN GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0247 WHICH HAS ENDURED FOR A LONG SPACE OF TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0248 ARE CAREFULLY EXAMINED THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONS ARE NEVER IN DISCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0249 AND OFTEN AFFORD CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF IT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT CERTAIN FORMS PERSIST WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0250 FROM THE OLDEST TO THE NEWEST FOSSILIFEROUS FORMATIONS AND THUS SHOW THAT PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT IS A CONTINGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0251 AND NOT A NECESSARY RESULT OF THE NATURE OF LIVING MATTER GEOLOGY IS AS IT WERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0252 THE BIOLOGY OF OUR PLANET AS A WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0253 IN SO FAR AS IT COMPRISES THE SURFACE CONFIGURATION AND THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0254 IT ANSWERS TO MORPHOLOGY IN SO FAR AS IT STUDIES CHANGES OF CONDITION AND THEIR CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0255 IT CORRESPONDS WITH PHYSIOLOGY IN SO FAR AS IT DEALS WITH THE CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0256 WHICH HAVE EFFECTED THE PROGRESS OF THE EARTH FROM ITS EARLIEST TO ITS PRESENT STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0257 IT FORMS PART OF THE GENERAL DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0258 AN INTERESTING CONTRAST BETWEEN THE GEOLOGY OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THAT OF HALF A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0259 IS PRESENTED BY THE COMPLETE EMANCIPATION OF THE MODERN GEOLOGIST FROM THE CONTROLLING AND PERVERTING INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0260 OF THEOLOGY ALL POWERFUL AT THE EARLIER DATE AS THE GEOLOGIST OF MY YOUNG DAYS WROTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0261 HE HAD ONE EYE UPON FACT AND THE OTHER ON GENESIS AT PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0262 HE WISELY KEEPS BOTH EYES ON FACT AND IGNORES THE PENTATEUCHAL MYTHOLOGY ALTOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0263 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY BROUGHT UPON ITS ILLUSTRIOUS AUTHOR A
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0264 PERIOD OF SOCIAL OSTRACISM THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO OUR CHILDREN IS BASED UPON THOSE PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0265 WHEWELL HAD THE COURAGE TO ATTACK LYELL'S FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTION WHICH SURELY IS A DICTATE OF COMMON SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0266 THAT WE OUGHT TO EXHAUST KNOWN CAUSES BEFORE SEEKING FOR THE EXPLANATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0267 OF GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN CAUSES OF WHICH WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0268 BUT GEOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO ITS PRESENT STATE BY WORKING FROM LYELL'S AXIOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0269 PERHAPS I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY BUTTON'S AXIOM FOR THAT GREAT NATURALIST AND WRITER EMBODIED THE PRINCIPLES OF SOUND GEOLOGY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0270 A PITHY PHRASE OF THE AND TO THIS DAY THE RECORD OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0271 AFFORDS NO PROOF THAT THE INTENSITY OR THE RAPIDITY OF THE CAUSES OF CHANGE HAS EVER VARIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0272 BETWEEN WIDER LIMITS THAN THOSE BETWEEN WHICH THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE YOUNGEST GEOLOGICAL EPOCHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0273 AN INCALCULABLE BENEFIT HAS ACCRUED TO GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE FROM THE ACCURATE AND DETAILED SURVEYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0274 WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN EXECUTED BY SKILLED GEOLOGISTS EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0275 IN GEOLOGY THE STUDY OF LARGE MAPS IS AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS SAID TO BE IN POLITICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0276 AND SECTIONS ON A TRUE SCALE ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0277 IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE APPREHENSION OF THE EXTRAORDINARY INSIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0278 OF GEOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS IN RELATION TO THE WHOLE MASS OF OUR PLANET
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0279 IT SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN THAT WHAT WE CALL CATASTROPHES ARE IN RELATION TO THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0280 CHANGES THE EQUIVALENTS OF WHICH WOULD BE WELL REPRESENTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW PIMPLES OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0281 THE SCRATCH OF A PIN ON A MAN'S HEAD VAST REGIONS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE REMAIN GEOLOGICALLY UNKNOWN BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0282 THE AREA ALREADY FAIRLY EXPLORED IS MANY TIMES GREATER THAN IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0283 AND IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL CRUST OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0284 HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED WITH GREAT MINUTENESS THE PARALLEL BETWEEN BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH I HAVE DRAWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0285 IS FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY THE MODERN GROWTH OF THAT BRANCH OF THE SCIENCE KNOWN AS PETROLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0286 WHICH ANSWERS TO HISTOLOGY AND HAS MADE THE MICROSCOPE AS ESSENTIAL AN INSTRUMENT TO THE GEOLOGICAL AS TO THE BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0287 THE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CAUSES NOW IN OPERATION HAS BEEN WONDERFULLY ENLARGED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0288 BY THE STUDY OF GLACIAL PHENOMENA BY THAT OF EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0289 AND BY THAT OF THE EFFICACY OF HEAT AND COLD WIND RAIN AND RIVERS AS AGENTS OF DENUDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0290 AND TRANSPORT ON THE OTHER HAND THE EXPLORATION OF CORAL REEFS AND OF THE DEPOSITS NOW TAKING PLACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT OCEANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0291 HAS PROVED THAT IN ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE WE HAVE AGENTS OF RECONSTRUCTION OF A POTENCY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0292 HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THERE IS NO STUDY BETTER FITTED THAN THAT OF GEOLOGY TO IMPRESS UPON MEN OF GENERAL CULTURE THAT CONVICTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0293 OF THE UNBROKEN SEQUENCE OF THE ORDER OF NATURAL PHENOMENA THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv/wav/adv0294 WHICH IS THE GREAT AND PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECT OF THE INCREASE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE

knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0004 THE FORESTS THE CONIFEROUS FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE THE GRANDEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0005 AND GROW IN A DELIGHTFUL CLIMATE ON THE MOST INTERESTING AND ACCESSIBLE OF MOUNTAIN RANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0006 YET STRANGE TO SAY THEY ARE NOT WELL KNOWN MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO DAVID DOUGLAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0007 AN ENTHUSIASTIC BOTANIST AND TREE LOVER WANDERED ALONE THROUGH FINE SECTIONS OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0008 AND SILVER FIR WOODS WILD WITH DELIGHT A FEW YEARS LATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0009 OTHER BOTANISTS MADE SHORT JOURNEYS FROM THE COAST INTO THE LOWER WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0010 THEN CAME THE WONDERFUL MULTITUDE OF MINERS INTO THE FOOT HILL ZONE MOSTLY BLIND WITH GOLD DUST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0011 SOON FOLLOWED BY SHEEPMEN WHO WITH WOOL OVER THEIR EYES CHASED THEIR FLOCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0012 THROUGH ALL THE FOREST BELTS FROM ONE END OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0013 THEN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED AND THOUSANDS OF ADMIRING TOURISTS PASSED THROUGH SECTIONS OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE ZONES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0014 ON THEIR WAY TO THAT WONDERFUL PARK AND GAINED FINE GLIMPSES OF THE SUGAR PINES AND SILVER FIRS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0015 ALONG THE EDGES OF DUSTY TRAILS AND ROADS BUT FEW INDEED STRONG AND FREE WITH EYES UNDIMMED WITH CARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0016 HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH WITH THE TREES TO GAIN ANYTHING LIKE A LOVING CONCEPTION OF THEIR GRANDEUR AND SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0017 AS MANIFESTED IN THE HARMONIES OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND VARYING ASPECTS THROUGHOUT THE SEASONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0018 AS THEY STAND ARRAYED IN THEIR WINTER GARB REJOICING IN STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0019 PUTTING FORTH THEIR FRESH LEAVES IN THE SPRING WHILE STEAMING WITH RESINY FRAGRANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0020 RECEIVING THE THUNDER SHOWERS OF SUMMER OR REPOSING HEAVY LADEN WITH RIPE CONES IN THE RICH SUNGOLD OF AUTUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0021 FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS KIND ONE MUST DWELL WITH THE TREES AND GROW WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0022 WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO TIME IN THE ALMANAC SENSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENERAL FOREST IN BELTS IS READILY PERCEIVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0023 THESE AS WE HAVE SEEN EXTEND IN REGULAR ORDER FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0024 AND HOWEVER DENSE AND SOMBER THEY MAY APPEAR IN GENERAL VIEWS NEITHER ON THE ROCKY HEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0025 NOR DOWN IN THE LEAFIEST HOLLOWS WILL YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REMIND YOU OF THE DANK MALARIAL SELVAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0026 OF THE AMAZON AND ORINOCO WITH THEIR BOUNDLESS CONTIGUITY OF SHADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0027 THE MONOTONOUS UNIFORMITY OF THE DEODAR FORESTS OF THE HIMALAYA THE BLACK FOREST OF EUROPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0028 OR THE DENSE DARK WOODS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE WHERE ROLLS THE OREGON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0029 THE GIANT PINES AND FIRS AND SEQUOIAS HOLD THEIR ARMS OPEN TO THE SUNLIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0030 RISING ABOVE ONE ANOTHER ON THE MOUNTAIN BENCHES MARSHALED IN GLORIOUS ARRAY GIVING FORTH THE UTMOST EXPRESSION OF GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0031 WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE VARIETY AND HARMONY THE INVITING OPENNESS OF THE SIERRA WOODS IS ONE OF THEIR MOST DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0032 THE TREES OF ALL THE SPECIES STAND MORE OR LESS APART IN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0033 OR IN SMALL IRREGULAR GROUPS ENABLING ONE TO FIND A WAY NEARLY EVERYWHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0034 ALONG SUNNY COLONNADES AND THROUGH OPENINGS THAT HAVE A SMOOTH PARK LIKE SURFACE STREWN WITH BROWN NEEDLES AND BURS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0035 NOW YOU CROSS A WILD GARDEN NOW A MEADOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0036 NOW A FERNY WILLOWY STREAM AND EVER AND ANON YOU EMERGE FROM ALL THE GROVES AND FLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0037 UPON SOME GRANITE PAVEMENT OR HIGH BARE RIDGE COMMANDING SUPERB VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0038 ABOVE THE WAVING SEA OF EVERGREENS FAR AND NEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0039 ONE WOULD EXPERIENCE BUT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN RIDING ON HORSEBACK THROUGH THE SUCCESSIVE BELTS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STORM BEATEN FRINGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0040 OF THE ICY PEAKS THE DEEP CANONS HOWEVER THAT EXTEND FROM THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0041 CUT THE BELTS MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY INTO SECTIONS AND PREVENT THE MOUNTED TRAVELER FROM TRACING THEM LENGTHWISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0042 THIS SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT IN ZONES AND SECTIONS BRINGS THE FOREST AS A WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0043 WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF EVERY OBSERVER THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE EVER FOUND OCCUPYING THE SAME RELATIVE POSITIONS TO ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0044 AS CONTROLLED BY SOIL CLIMATE AND THE COMPARATIVE VIGOR OF EACH SPECIES IN TAKING AND HOLDING THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0045 AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS ONE NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0046 THE ELEVATION ABOVE SEA LEVEL BY THE TREES ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0047 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE SPECIES RANGE UPWARD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET AND ALL PASS ONE ANOTHER MORE OR LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0048 YET EVEN THOSE POSSESSING THE GREATEST VERTICAL RANGE ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS CONNECTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0049 AS MUCH AS THEY TAKE ON NEW FORMS CORRESPONDING WITH THE VARIATIONS IN ALTITUDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0050 CROSSING THE TREELESS PLAINS OF THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN FROM THE WEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0051 AND REACHING THE SIERRA FOOT HILLS YOU ENTER THE LOWER FRINGE OF THE FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0052 COMPOSED OF SMALL OAKS AND PINES GROWING SO FAR APART
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0053 THAT NOT ONE TWENTIETH OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IS IN SHADE AT CLEAR NOONDAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0054 AFTER ADVANCING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES AND MAKING AN ASCENT OF FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0055 YOU REACH THE LOWER MARGIN OF THE MAIN PINE BELT COMPOSED OF THE GIGANTIC SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0056 YELLOW PINE INCENSE CEDAR AND SEQUOIA NEXT YOU COME TO THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0057 AND LASTLY TO THE UPPER PINE BELT WHICH SWEEPS UP THE ROCKY ACCLIVITIES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0058 IN A DWARFED WAVERING FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0059 THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION WITH REFERENCE TO CLIMATE DEPENDENT ON ELEVATION IS PERCEIVED AT ONCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0060 BUT THERE ARE OTHER HARMONIES AS FAR REACHING IN THIS CONNECTION THAT BECOME MANIFEST ONLY AFTER PATIENT OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0061 AND STUDY PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0062 IN LONG CURVING BANDS BRAIDED TOGETHER INTO LACE LIKE PATTERNS AND OUTSPREAD IN CHARMING VARIETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0063 THE KEY TO THIS BEAUTIFUL HARMONY IS THE ANCIENT GLACIERS WHERE THEY FLOWED THE TREES FOLLOWED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0064 TRACING THEIR WAVERING COURSES ALONG CANONS OVER RIDGES AND OVER HIGH ROLLING PLATEAUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0065 THE CEDARS OF LEBANON SAYS HOOKER ARE GROWING UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0066 ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0067 EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CUTTING GAPS DISINTEGRATING BOULDERS AND CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING MATERIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0068 INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE BY ANY SAVE STUDENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0069 WHO TRACE THEIR TRANSITIONAL FORMS DOWN FROM THE FRESH MORAINES STILL IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0070 THROUGH THOSE THAT ARE MORE AND MORE ANCIENT AND MORE AND MORE OBSCURED BY VEGETATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0071 AND ALL KINDS OF POST GLACIAL WEATHERING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0072 HAD THE ICE SHEET THAT ONCE COVERED ALL THE RANGE BEEN MELTED SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE FOOT HILLS TO THE SUMMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0073 THE FLANKS WOULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN LEFT ALMOST BARE OF SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0074 AND THESE NOBLE FORESTS WOULD BE WANTING MANY GROVES AND THICKETS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE GROWN UP ON LAKE AND AVALANCHE BEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0075 AND MANY A FAIR FLOWER AND SHRUB WOULD HAVE FOUND FOOD AND A DWELLING PLACE IN WEATHERED NOOKS AND CREVICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0076 BUT THE SIERRA AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BARE ROCKY DESERT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0077 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE SIERRA FORESTS IN GENERAL INDICATE THE EXTENT AND POSITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORAINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0078 AS WELL AS THEY DO LINES OF CLIMATE FOR FORESTS PROPERLY SPEAKING CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0079 AND SINCE THE MORAINES HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED UPON THE SOLID ROCK AND ONLY UPON ELECTED PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0080 LEAVING A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE OLD GLACIAL SURFACE BARE WE FIND LUXURIANT FORESTS OF PINE AND FIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0081 ABRUPTLY TERMINATED BY SCORED AND POLISHED PAVEMENTS ON WHICH NOT EVEN A MOSS IS GROWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0082 THOUGH SOIL ALONE IS REQUIRED TO FIT THEM FOR THE GROWTH OF TREES TWO HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0083 THE NUT PINE PINUS SABINIANA THE NUT PINE THE FIRST CONIFER MET IN ASCENDING THE RANGE FROM THE WEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0084 GROWS ONLY ON THE TORRID FOOTHILLS SEEMING TO DELIGHT IN THE MOST ARDENT SUN HEAT LIKE A PALM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0085 SPRINGING UP HERE AND THERE SINGLY OR IN SCATTERED GROUPS OF FIVE OR SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0086 AMONG SCRUBBY WHITE OAKS AND THICKETS OF CEANOTHUS AND MANZANITA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0087 ITS EXTREME UPPER LIMIT BEING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA ITS LOWER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0088 ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET THIS TREE IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS AIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0089 WIDESPREAD TROPICAL APPEARANCE WHICH SUGGESTS A REGION OF PALMS RATHER THAN COOL RESINY PINE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0090 NO ONE WOULD TAKE IT AT FIRST SIGHT TO BE A CONIFER OF ANY KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0091 IT IS SO LOOSE IN HABIT AND SO WIDELY BRANCHED AND ITS FOLIAGE IS SO THIN AND GRAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0092 FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0093 THE TRUNK USUALLY DIVIDES INTO THREE OR FOUR MAIN BRANCHES ABOUT FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FEET FROM THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0094 WHICH AFTER BEARING AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER SHOOT STRAIGHT UP AND FORM SEPARATE SUMMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0095 WHILE THE CROOKED SUBORDINATE BRANCHES ASPIRE AND RADIATE AND DROOP IN ORNAMENTAL SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0096 THE SLENDER GRAYISH GREEN NEEDLES ARE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE INCHES LONG LOOSELY TASSELED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0097 AND INCLINED TO DROOP IN HANDSOME CURVES CONTRASTING WITH THE STIFF DARK COLORED TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0098 AND BRANCHES IN A VERY STRIKING MANNER NO OTHER TREE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE SO SUBSTANTIAL IN BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0099 IS IN ITS FOLIAGE SO THIN AND SO PERVIOUS TO THE LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0100 THE SUNBEAMS SIFT THROUGH EVEN THE LEAFIEST TREES WITH SCARCELY ANY INTERRUPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0101 AND THE WEARY HEATED TRAVELER FINDS BUT LITTLE PROTECTION IN THEIR SHADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0102 THE GENEROUS CROP OF NUTRITIOUS NUTS WHICH THE NUT PINE YIELDS MAKES IT A FAVORITE WITH INDIANS BEARS AND SQUIRRELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0103 THE CONES ARE MOST BEAUTIFUL MEASURING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT INCHES IN LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0104 AND NOT MUCH LESS IN THICKNESS RICH CHOCOLATE BROWN IN COLOR AND PROTECTED BY STRONG DOWN CURVING HOOKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0105 WHICH TERMINATE THE SCALES NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAN OPEN THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0106 INDIANS GATHERING THE RIPE NUTS MAKE A STRIKING PICTURE THE MEN CLIMB THE TREES LIKE BEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0107 AND BEAT OFF THE CONES WITH STICKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0108 OR RECKLESSLY CUT OFF THE MORE FRUITFUL BRANCHES WITH HATCHETS WHILE THE SQUAWS GATHER THE BIG GENEROUS CONES AND ROAST THEM UNTIL THE SCALES OPEN SUFFICIENTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0109 TO ALLOW THE HARD SHELLED SEEDS TO BE BEATEN OUT THEN IN THE COOL EVENINGS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0110 THEIR CAPACITY FOR DIRT GREATLY INCREASED BY THE SOFT RESIN WITH WHICH THEY ARE ALL BEDRAGGLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0111 FORM CIRCLES AROUND CAMP FIRES ON THE BANK OF THE NEAREST STREAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0112 AND LIE IN EASY INDEPENDENCE CRACKING NUTS AND LAUGHING AND CHATTERING AS HEEDLESS OF THE FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0113 AS THE SQUIRRELS PINUS TUBERCULATA THIS CURIOUS LITTLE PINE IS FOUND AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0114 GROWING IN CLOSE WILLOWY GROVES IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0115 ALTHOUGH TREES THAT CHANCE TO STAND ALONE OUTSIDE THE GROVES SWEEP FORTH LONG CURVED BRANCHES PRODUCING A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY GROVE FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0116 THE FOLIAGE IS OF THE SAME PECULIAR GRAY GREEN COLOR AS THAT OF THE NUT PINE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0117 IS WORN ABOUT AS LOOSELY SO THAT THE BODY OF THE TREE IS SCARCELY OBSCURED BY IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0118 AT THE AGE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS IT BEGINS TO BEAR CONES NOT ON BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0119 BUT ON THE MAIN AXIS AND AS THEY NEVER FALL OFF THE TRUNK IS SOON PICTURESQUELY DOTTED WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0120 THE BRANCHES ALSO BECOME FRUITFUL AFTER THEY ATTAIN SUFFICIENT SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0121 THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE OLDER TREES IS ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0122 AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG EXCEEDINGLY HARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0123 AND COVERED WITH A SORT OF SILICIOUS VARNISH AND GUM RENDERING THEM IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0124 EVIDENTLY WITH A VIEW TO THE CAREFUL PRESERVATION OF THE SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0125 NO OTHER CONIFER IN THE RANGE IS SO CLOSELY RESTRICTED TO SPECIAL LOCALITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0126 IT IS USUALLY FOUND APART STANDING DEEP IN CHAPARRAL ON SUNNY HILL AND CANON SIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0127 WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE DEPTH OF SOIL AND WHERE FOUND AT ALL IT IS QUITE PLENTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0128 BUT THE ORDINARY TRAVELER FOLLOWING CARRIAGE ROADS AND TRAILS MAY ASCEND THE RANGE MANY TIMES WITHOUT MEETING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0129 WHILE EXPLORING THE LOWER PORTION OF THE MERCED CANON I FOUND A LONELY MINER SEEKING HIS FORTUNE IN A QUARTZ VEIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0130 ON A WILD MOUNTAIN SIDE PLANTED WITH THIS SINGULAR TREE HE TOLD ME THAT HE CALLED IT THE HICKORY PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0131 BECAUSE OF THE WHITENESS AND TOUGHNESS OF THE WOOD IT IS SO LITTLE KNOWN HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0132 THAT IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE A COMMON NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0133 MOST MOUNTAINEERS REFER TO IT AS THAT QUEER LITTLE PINE TREE COVERED ALL OVER WITH BURS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0134 IN MY STUDIES OF THIS SPECIES I FOUND A VERY INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP OF FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0135 WHOSE RELATIONS WILL BE SEEN ALMOST AS SOON AS STATED FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0136 ALL THE TREES IN THE GROVES I EXAMINED HOWEVER UNEQUAL IN SIZE ARE OF THE SAME AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0137 SECOND THOSE GROVES ARE ALL PLANTED ON DRY HILLSIDES COVERED WITH CHAPARRAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0138 AND THEREFORE ARE LIABLE TO BE SWEPT BY FIRE THIRD THERE ARE NO SEEDLINGS OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0139 IN OR ABOUT THE LIVING GROVES BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A FINE HOPEFUL CROP SPRINGING UP ON THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0140 ONCE OCCUPIED BY ANY GROVE THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE BURNING OF THE CHAPARRAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0141 FOURTH THE CONES NEVER FALL OFF AND NEVER DISCHARGE THEIR SEEDS UNTIL THE TREE OR BRANCH TO WHICH THEY BELONG DIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0142 A FULL DISCUSSION OF THE BEARING OF THESE FACTS UPON ONE ANOTHER WOULD PERHAPS BE OUT OF PLACE HERE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0143 I MAY AT LEAST CALL ATTENTION TO THE ADMIRABLE ADAPTATION OF THE TREE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0144 THE FIRE SWEPT REGIONS WHERE ALONE IT IS FOUND AFTER A GROVE HAS BEEN DESTROYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0145 THE GROUND IS AT ONCE SOWN LAVISHLY WITH ALL THE SEEDS RIPENED DURING ITS WHOLE LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0146 WHICH SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY HELD IN STORE WITH REFERENCE TO SUCH A CALAMITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0147 THEN A YOUNG GROVE IMMEDIATELY SPRINGS UP GIVING BEAUTY FOR ASHES SUGAR PINE PINUS LAMBERTIANA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0148 THIS IS THE NOBLEST PINE YET DISCOVERED SURPASSING ALL OTHERS NOT MERELY IN SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0149 BUT ALSO IN KINGLY BEAUTY AND MAJESTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0150 IT TOWERS SUBLIMELY FROM EVERY RIDGE AND CANON OF THE RANGE AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM THREE TO SEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0151 ATTAINING MOST PERFECT DEVELOPMENT AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0152 FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE COMMONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0153 THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH IS OCCASIONALLY MET THAT HAS ENJOYED FIVE OR SIX CENTURIES OF STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0154 AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET LIVING ON UNDECAYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0155 SWEET AND FRESH IN EVERY FIBER IN SOUTHERN OREGON WHERE IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY DAVID DOUGLAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0156 ON THE HEAD WATERS OF THE UMPQUA IT ATTAINS STILL GRANDER DIMENSIONS ONE SPECIMEN HAVING BEEN MEASURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0157 THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FEET HIGH AND OVER EIGHTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0158 THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE DISCOVERER WAS THE DOUGLAS FOR WHOM THE NOBLE DOUGLAS SPRUCE IS NAMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0159 AND MANY OTHER PLANTS WHICH WILL KEEP HIS MEMORY SWEET AND FRESH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0160 AS LONG AS TREES AND FLOWERS ARE LOVED HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE PACIFIC COAST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0161 WAS MADE IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE THE OREGON INDIANS WATCHED HIM WITH CURIOSITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0162 AS HE WANDERED IN THE WOODS COLLECTING SPECIMENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0163 AND UNLIKE THE FUR GATHERING STRANGERS THEY HAD HITHERTO KNOWN CARING NOTHING ABOUT TRADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0164 AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO KNOW HIM BETTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0165 AND SAW THAT FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE GROWING THINGS OF THE WOODS AND PRAIRIES WERE HIS ONLY OBJECTS OF PURSUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0166 THEY CALLED HIM THE MAN OF GRASS A TITLE OF WHICH HE WAS PROUD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0167 DURING HIS FIRST SUMMER ON THE WATERS OF THE COLUMBIA HE MADE FORT VANCOUVER HIS HEADQUARTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0168 MAKING EXCURSIONS FROM THIS HUDSON BAY POST IN EVERY DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0169 ON ONE OF HIS LONG TRIPS HE SAW IN AN INDIAN'S POUCH SOME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0170 OF THE SEEDS OF A NEW SPECIES OF PINE WHICH HE LEARNED WERE OBTAINED FROM A VERY LARGE TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0171 FAR TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE COLUMBIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0172 AT THE END OF THE NEXT SUMMER RETURNING TO FORT VANCOUVER AFTER THE SETTING IN OF THE WINTER RAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0173 BEARING IN MIND THE BIG PINE HE HAD HEARD OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0174 HE SET OUT ON AN EXCURSION UP THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY IN SEARCH OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0175 AND HOW HE FARED AND WHAT DANGERS AND HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0176 ARE BEST TOLD IN HIS OWN JOURNAL FROM WHICH I QUOTE AS FOLLOWS OCTOBER TWENTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0177 EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX WEATHER DULL COLD AND CLOUDY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0178 WHEN MY FRIENDS IN ENGLAND ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH MY TRAVELS I FEAR THEY WILL THINK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0179 I HAVE TOLD THEM NOTHING BUT MY MISERIES I QUITTED MY CAMP EARLY IN THE MORNING TO SURVEY THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0180 LEAVING MY GUIDE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE HORSES UNTIL MY RETURN IN THE EVENING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0181 ABOUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM THE CAMP I MET AN INDIAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0182 WHO ON PERCEIVING ME INSTANTLY STRUNG HIS BOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0183 PLACED ON HIS LEFT ARM A SLEEVE OF RACCOON SKIN AND STOOD ON THE DEFENSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0184 BEING QUITE SURE THAT CONDUCT WAS PROMPTED BY FEAR AND NOT BY HOSTILE INTENTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0185 THE POOR FELLOW HAVING PROBABLY NEVER SEEN SUCH A BEING AS MYSELF BEFORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0186 I LAID MY GUN AT MY FEET ON THE GROUND AND WAVED MY HAND FOR HIM TO COME TO ME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0187 WHICH HE DID SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT CAUTION I THEN MADE HIM PLACE HIS BOW AND QUIVER OF ARROWS BESIDE MY GUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0188 AND STRIKING A LIGHT GAVE HIM A SMOKE OUT OF MY OWN PIPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0189 AND A PRESENT OF A FEW BEADS WITH MY PENCIL I MADE A ROUGH SKETCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0190 OF THE CONE AND PINE TREE WHICH I WANTED TO OBTAIN AND DREW HIS ATTENTION TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0191 WHEN HE INSTANTLY POINTED WITH HIS HAND TO THE HILLS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES DISTANT TOWARDS THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0192 AND WHEN I EXPRESSED MY INTENTION OF GOING THITHER CHEERFULLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPANY ME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0193 AT MIDDAY I REACHED MY LONG WISHED FOR PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0194 AND LOST NO TIME IN EXAMINING THEM AND ENDEAVORING TO COLLECT SPECIMENS AND SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0195 NEW AND STRANGE THINGS SELDOM FAIL TO MAKE STRONG IMPRESSIONS AND ARE THEREFORE FREQUENTLY OVER RATED SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0196 THAT LEST I SHOULD NEVER SEE MY FRIENDS IN ENGLAND TO INFORM THEM VERBALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0197 OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND IMMENSELY GRAND TREE I SHALL HERE STATE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE LARGEST I COULD FIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0198 AMONG SEVERAL THAT HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN BY THE WIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0199 AT THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE IS FIFTY SEVEN FEET NINE INCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0200 AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR FEET SEVENTEEN FEET FIVE INCHES THE EXTREME LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0201 TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FEET AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE EITHER TO CLIMB THE TREE OR HEW IT DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0202 I ENDEAVORED TO KNOCK OFF THE CONES BY FIRING AT THEM WITH BALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0203 WHEN THE REPORT OF MY GUN BROUGHT EIGHT INDIANS ALL OF THEM PAINTED WITH RED EARTH ARMED WITH BOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0204 ARROWS BONE TIPPED SPEARS AND FLINT KNIVES THEY APPEARED ANYTHING BUT FRIENDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0205 I EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT I WANTED AND THEY SEEMED SATISFIED AND SAT DOWN TO SMOKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0206 BUT PRESENTLY I SAW ONE OF THEM STRING HIS BOW AND ANOTHER SHARPEN HIS FLINT KNIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0207 WITH A PAIR OF WOODEN PINCERS AND SUSPEND IT OFF THE WRIST OF HIS RIGHT HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0208 FURTHER TESTIMONY OF THEIR INTENTIONS WAS UNNECESSARY TO SAVE MYSELF BY FLIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0209 SO WITHOUT HESITATION I STEPPED BACK ABOUT FIVE PACES COCKED MY GUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0210 DREW ONE OF THE PISTOLS OUT OF MY BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0211 AND HOLDING IT IN MY LEFT HAND AND THE GUN IN MY RIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0212 SHOWED MYSELF DETERMINED TO FIGHT FOR MY LIFE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ENDEAVORED TO PRESERVE MY COOLNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0213 AND THUS WE STOOD LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0214 OR UTTERING A WORD FOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0215 WHEN ONE AT LAST WHO SEEMED TO BE THE LEADER GAVE A SIGN THAT THEY WISHED FOR SOME TOBACCO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0216 THIS I SIGNIFIED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE IF THEY FETCHED A QUANTITY OF CONES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0217 THEY WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY IN SEARCH OF THEM AND NO SOONER WERE THEY ALL OUT OF SIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0218 THAN I PICKED UP MY THREE CONES AND SOME TWIGS OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0219 AND MADE THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE RETREAT HURRYING BACK TO THE CAMP WHICH I REACHED BEFORE DUSK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0220 I NOW WRITE LYING ON THE GRASS WITH MY GUN COCKED BESIDE ME AND PENNING THESE LINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0221 BY THE LIGHT OF MY COLUMBIAN CANDLE NAMELY AN IGNITED PIECE OF ROSIN WOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0222 THIS GRAND PINE DISCOVERED UNDER SUCH EXCITING CIRCUMSTANCES DOUGLAS NAMED IN HONOR OF HIS FRIEND DR LAMBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0223 OF LONDON THE TRUNK IS A SMOOTH ROUND DELICATELY TAPERED SHAFT MOSTLY WITHOUT LIMBS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0224 AND COLORED RICH PURPLISH BROWN USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF YELLOW LICHEN AT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0225 THE TOP OF THIS MAGNIFICENT BOLE LONG CURVING BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0226 SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN BUT FAR MORE NOBLY IMPRESSIVE THAN ANY PALM CROWN I EVER BEHELD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0227 THE NEEDLES ARE ABOUT THREE INCHES LONG FINELY TEMPERED AND ARRANGED IN RATHER CLOSE TASSELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0228 AT THE ENDS OF SLENDER BRANCHLETS THAT CLOTHE THE LONG OUTSWEEPING LIMBS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0229 HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0230 BY THE IMMENSE CYLINDRICAL CONES THAT DEPEND LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE MAIN BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0231 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT NATURE CAN DO IN THE WAY OF PINE BURS UNTIL HE HAS SEEN THOSE OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0232 THEY ARE COMMONLY FROM FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0233 GREEN SHADED WITH DARK PURPLE ON THEIR SUNWARD SIDES THEY ARE RIPE IN SEPTEMBER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0234 AND OCTOBER THEN THE FLAT SCALES OPEN AND THE SEEDS TAKE WING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0235 BUT THE EMPTY CONES BECOME STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL AND EFFECTIVE FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0236 THEIR DIAMETER IS NEARLY DOUBLED BY THE SPREADING OF THE SCALES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0237 AND THEIR COLOR CHANGES TO A WARM YELLOWISH BROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0238 WHILE THEY REMAIN SWINGING ON THE TREE ALL THE FOLLOWING WINTER AND SUMMER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0239 AND CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY BEAUTIFUL EVEN ON THE GROUND MANY YEARS AFTER THEY FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0240 THE WOOD IS DELICIOUSLY FRAGRANT AND FINE IN GRAIN AND TEXTURE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0241 IS OF A RICH CREAM YELLOW AS IF FORMED OF CONDENSED SUNBEAMS RETINOSPORA OBTUSA SIEBOLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0242 THE GLORY OF EASTERN FORESTS IS CALLED FU SI NO KI TREE OF THE SUN BY THE JAPANESE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0243 THE SUGAR PINE IS THE SUN TREE OF THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0244 UNFORTUNATELY IT IS GREATLY PRIZED BY THE LUMBERMEN AND IN ACCESSIBLE PLACES IS ALWAYS THE FIRST TREE IN THE WOODS TO FEEL THEIR STEEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0245 BUT THE REGULAR LUMBERMEN WITH THEIR SAW MILLS HAVE BEEN LESS GENERALLY DESTRUCTIVE THUS FAR THAN THE SHINGLE MAKERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0246 THE WOOD SPLITS FREELY AND THERE IS A CONSTANT DEMAND FOR THE SHINGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0247 AND BECAUSE AN AX AND SAW AND FROW ARE ALL THE CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR THE BUSINESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0248 MANY OF THAT DRIFTING UNSTEADY CLASS OF MEN SO LARGE IN CALIFORNIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0249 ENGAGE IN IT FOR A FEW MONTHS IN THE YEAR WHEN PROSPECTORS HUNTERS RANCH HANDS ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0250 TOUCH THEIR BOTTOM DOLLAR AND FIND THEMSELVES OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THEY SAY WELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0251 I CAN AT LEAST GO TO THE SUGAR PINES AND MAKE SHINGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0252 A FEW POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AND A SINGLE LENGTH CUT FROM THE FIRST TREE FELLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0253 PRODUCES BOARDS ENOUGH FOR THE WALLS AND ROOF OF A CABIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0254 ALL THE REST THE LUMBERMAN MAKES IS FOR SALE AND HE IS SPEEDILY INDEPENDENT NO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0255 GARDENER OR HAYMAKER IS MORE SWEETLY PERFUMED THAN THESE ROUGH MOUNTAINEERS WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0256 BUT THE HAVOC THEY MAKE IS MOST DEPLORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0257 THE SUGAR FROM WHICH THE COMMON NAME IS DERIVED IS TO MY TASTE THE BEST OF SWEETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0258 BETTER THAN MAPLE SUGAR IT EXUDES FROM THE HEART WOOD WHERE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0259 EITHER BY FOREST FIRES OR THE AX IN THE SHAPE OF IRREGULAR CRISP CANDY LIKE KERNELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0260 WHICH ARE CROWDED TOGETHER IN MASSES OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE LIKE CLUSTERS OF RESIN BEADS WHEN FRESH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0261 IT IS PERFECTLY WHITE AND DELICIOUS BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WOUNDS ON WHICH IT IS FOUND HAVE BEEN MADE BY FIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0262 THE EXUDING SAP IS STAINED ON THE CHARRED SURFACE AND THE HARDENED SUGAR BECOMES BROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0263 INDIANS ARE FOND OF IT BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LAXATIVE PROPERTIES ONLY SMALL QUANTITIES MAY BE EATEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0264 BEARS SO FOND OF SWEET THINGS IN GENERAL SEEM NEVER TO TASTE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0265 AT LEAST I HAVE FAILED TO FIND ANY TRACE OF THEIR TEETH IN THIS CONNECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0266 NO LOVER OF TREES WILL EVER FORGET HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0267 NOR WILL HE AFTERWARD NEED A POET TO CALL HIM TO LISTEN WHAT THE PINE TREE SAITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0268 IN MOST PINE TREES THERE IS A SAMENESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH TO MOST PEOPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0269 IS APT TO BECOME MONOTONOUS FOR THE TYPICAL SPIRY FORM HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0270 AFFORDS BUT LITTLE SCOPE FOR APPRECIABLE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER THE SUGAR PINE IS AS FREE FROM CONVENTIONALITIES OF FORM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0271 MOTION AS ANY OAK NO TWO ARE ALIKE EVEN TO THE MOST INATTENTIVE OBSERVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0272 AND NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE EVER TOSSING OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM MOST EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0273 THERE IS A MAJESTY AND REPOSE ABOUT THEM THAT PRECLUDES ALL POSSIBILITY OF THE GROTESQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0274 OR EVEN PICTURESQUE IN THEIR GENERAL EXPRESSION THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0275 AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0276 THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0277 THE WHITE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT NOBLE AS THESE ARE THE SUGAR PINE IS EASILY KING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0278 AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0279 THE MAIN BRANCHES ARE SOMETIMES FOUND TO BE FORTY FEET IN LENGTH YET PERSISTENTLY SIMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0280 SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0281 BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0282 THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0283 A CROWN SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET WIDE IS FORMED WHICH GRACEFULLY POISED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE NOBLE SHAFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0284 AND FILLED WITH SUNSHINE IS ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS FOREST OBJECTS CONCEIVABLE COMMONLY HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0285 THERE IS A GREAT PREPONDERANCE OF LIMBS TOWARD THE EAST AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0286 NO OTHER PINE SEEMS TO ME SO UNFAMILIAR AND SELF CONTAINED IN APPROACHING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0287 WE FEEL AS IF IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR BEING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0288 AND BEGIN TO WALK WITH A LIGHT STEP HOLDING OUR BREATH THEN PERCHANCE WHILE WE GAZE AWE STRICKEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0289 ALONG COMES A MERRY SQUIRREL CHATTERING AND LAUGHING TO BREAK THE SPELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0290 RUNNING UP THE TRUNK WITH NO CEREMONY AND GNAWING OFF THE CONES AS IF THEY WERE MADE ONLY FOR HIM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0291 WHILE THE CARPENTER WOODPECKER HAMMERS AWAY AT THE BARK DRILLING HOLES IN WHICH TO STORE HIS WINTER SUPPLY OF ACORNS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0292 ALTHOUGH SO WILD AND UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0293 THE OLD IS THE MOST ORIGINAL AND INDEPENDENT IN APPEARANCE OF ALL THE SIERRA EVERGREENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0294 THE YOUNG IS THE MOST REGULAR A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS SLIM ERECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0295 WITH LEAFY SUPPLE BRANCHES KEPT EXACTLY IN PLACE EACH TAPERING IN OUTLINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0296 AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSITIONAL FORMS PRESENTED BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0297 OFFER A DELIGHTFUL STUDY AT THE AGE OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS THE SHY FASHIONABLE FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0298 BEGINS TO BE BROKEN UP SPECIALIZED BRANCHES PUSH OUT IN THE MOST UNTHOUGHT OF PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0299 AND BEND WITH THE GREAT CONES AT ONCE MARKING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0300 AND THIS BEING CONSTANTLY AUGMENTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR BY THE VARYING ACTION OF THE SUNLIGHT WINDS SNOW STORMS ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0301 THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE TREE IS NEVER AGAIN LOST IN THE GENERAL FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0302 THE MOST CONSTANT COMPANION OF THIS SPECIES IS THE YELLOW PINE AND A WORTHY COMPANION IT IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0303 THE DOUGLAS SPRUCE LIBOCEDRUS SEQUOIA AND THE WHITE SILVER FIR ARE ALSO MORE OR LESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0304 BUT ON MANY DEEP SOILED MOUNTAIN SIDES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0305 IT FORMS THE BULK OF THE FOREST FILLING EVERY SWELL AND HOLLOW AND DOWN PLUNGING RAVINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0306 THE MAJESTIC CROWNS APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN BOLD CURVES MAKE A GLORIOUS CANOPY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0307 THROUGH WHICH THE TEMPERED SUNBEAMS POUR SILVERING THE NEEDLES AND GILDING THE MASSIVE BOLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0308 AND FLOWERY PARK LIKE GROUND INTO A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0309 THE MOST SUNNY SLOPES THE WHITE FLOWERED FRAGRANT CHAMOEBATIA IS SPREAD LIKE A CARPET BRIGHTENED DURING EARLY SUMMER WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0310 THE CRIMSON SARCODES THE WILD ROSE AND INNUMERABLE VIOLETS AND GILIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0311 NOT EVEN IN THE SHADIEST NOOKS WILL YOU FIND ANY RANK UNTIDY WEEDS OR UNWHOLESOME DARKNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0312 ON THE NORTH SIDES OF RIDGES THE BOLES ARE MORE SLENDER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0313 THE GROUND IS MOSTLY OCCUPIED BY AN UNDERBRUSH OF HAZEL CEANOTHUS AND FLOWERING DOGWOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0314 BUT NEVER SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT THE TRAVELER FROM SAUNTERING WHERE HE WILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0315 WHILE THE CROWNING BRANCHES ARE NEVER IMPENETRABLE TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND NEVER SO INTERBLENDED AS TO LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0316 VIEW THE FOREST FROM BENEATH OR FROM SOME COMMANDING RIDGE TOP EACH TREE PRESENTS A STUDY IN ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0317 AND PROCLAIMS THE SURPASSING GRANDEUR OF THE SPECIES YELLOW OR SILVER PINE PINUS PONDEROSA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0318 THE SILVER OR YELLOW PINE AS IT IS COMMONLY CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0319 RANKS SECOND AMONG THE PINES OF THE SIERRA AS A LUMBER TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0320 AND ALMOST RIVALS THE SUGAR PINE IN STATURE AND NOBLENESS OF PORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0321 BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR POWERS OF ENDURING VARIATIONS OF CLIMATE AND SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0322 IT HAS A MORE EXTENSIVE RANGE THAN ANY OTHER CONIFER GROWING ON THE SIERRA ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0323 THE WESTERN SLOPE IT IS FIRST MET AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0324 AND EXTENDS NEARLY TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE TIMBER LINE THENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0325 CROSSING THE RANGE BY THE LOWEST PASSES IT DESCENDS TO THE EASTERN BASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0326 AND PUSHES OUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE INTO THE HOT VOLCANIC PLAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0327 GROWING BRAVELY UPON WELL WATERED MORAINES GRAVELLY LAKE BASINS ARCTIC RIDGES AND TORRID LAVA BEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0328 PLANTING ITSELF UPON THE LIPS OF CRATERS FLOURISHING VIGOROUSLY EVEN THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0329 AND TOSSING RIPE CONES AMONG THE ASHES AND CINDERS OF NATURE'S HEARTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0330 THE AVERAGE SIZE OF FULL GROWN TREES ON THE WESTERN SLOPE WHERE IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0331 IS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM FIVE TO SIX FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0332 THOUGH SPECIMENS MAY EASILY BE FOUND THAT ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER I MEASURED ONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0333 GROWING AT AN ELEVATION OF FOUR THOUSAND FEET IN THE VALLEY OF THE MERCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0334 THAT IS A FEW INCHES OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH WHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0335 THERE IS PLENTY OF FREE SUNSHINE AND OTHER CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0336 IT PRESENTS A STRIKING CONTRAST IN FORM TO THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0337 BEING A SYMMETRICAL SPIRE FORMED OF A STRAIGHT ROUND TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0338 CLAD WITH INNUMERABLE BRANCHES THAT ARE DIVIDED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0339 ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY BRANCHLESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0340 BUT WHERE IT GROWS AT ALL CLOSE THREE FOURTHS OR MORE BECOME NAKED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0341 THE TREE PRESENTING THEN A MORE SLENDER AND ELEGANT SHAFT THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0342 THE BARK IS MOSTLY ARRANGED IN MASSIVE PLATES SOME OF THEM MEASURING FOUR OR FIVE FEET IN LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0343 BY EIGHTEEN INCHES IN WIDTH WITH A THICKNESS OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0344 FORMING A QUITE MARKED AND DISTINGUISHING FEATURE THE NEEDLES ARE OF A FINE WARM YELLOW GREEN COLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0345 SIX TO EIGHT INCHES LONG FIRM AND ELASTIC AND CROWDED IN HANDSOME RADIANT TASSELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0346 ON THE UPTURNING ENDS OF THE BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES LONG AND TWO AND A HALF WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0347 GROWING IN CLOSE SESSILE CLUSTERS AMONG THE LEAVES THE SPECIES ATTAINS ITS NOBLEST FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0348 IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE OF THE OLDER YOSEMITES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0349 AND SO PROMINENT A PART DOES IT FORM OF THEIR GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0350 THAT IT MAY WELL BE CALLED THE YOSEMITE PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0351 RIPE SPECIMENS FAVORABLY SITUATED ARE ALMOST ALWAYS TWO HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0352 AND THE BRANCHES CLOTHE THE TRUNK NEARLY TO THE GROUND AS SEEN IN THE ILLUSTRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0353 THE JEFFREY VARIETY ATTAINS ITS FINEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE RANGE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0354 THE WIDE BASINS OF THE MCCLOUD AND PITT RIVERS WHERE IT FORMS MAGNIFICENT FORESTS SCARCELY INVADED BY ANY OTHER TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0355 IT DIFFERS FROM THE ORDINARY FORM IN SIZE BEING ONLY ABOUT HALF AS TALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0356 AND IN ITS REDDER AND MORE CLOSELY FURROWED BARK GRAYISH GREEN FOLIAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0357 LESS DIVIDED BRANCHES AND LARGER CONES BUT INTERMEDIATE FORMS COME IN WHICH MAKE A CLEAR SEPARATION IMPOSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0358 ALTHOUGH SOME BOTANISTS REGARD IT AS A DISTINCT SPECIES IT IS THIS VARIETY THAT CLIMBS STORM SWEPT RIDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0359 AND WANDERS OUT AMONG THE VOLCANOES OF THE GREAT BASIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0360 WHETHER EXPOSED TO EXTREMES OF HEAT OR COLD IT IS DWARFED LIKE EVERY OTHER TREE AND BECOMES ALL KNOTS AND ANGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0361 WHOLLY UNLIKE THE MAJESTIC FORMS WE HAVE BEEN SKETCHING OLD SPECIMENS BEARING CONES ABOUT AS BIG AS PINEAPPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0362 MAY SOMETIMES BE FOUND CLINGING TO RIFTED ROCKS AT AN ELEVATION OF SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0363 WHOSE HIGHEST BRANCHES SCARCE REACH ABOVE ONE'S SHOULDERS I HAVE OFTENTIMES FEASTED ON THE BEAUTY OF THESE NOBLE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0364 WHEN THEY WERE TOWERING IN ALL THEIR WINTER GRANDEUR LADEN WITH SNOW ONE MASS OF BLOOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0365 IN SUMMER TOO WHEN THE BROWN STAMINATE CLUSTERS HANG THICK AMONG THE SHIMMERING NEEDLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0366 AND THE BIG PURPLE BURS ARE RIPENING IN THE MELLOW LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0367 BUT IT IS DURING CLOUDLESS WIND STORMS THAT THESE COLOSSAL PINES ARE MOST IMPRESSIVELY BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0368 THEN THEY BOW LIKE WILLOWS THEIR LEAVES STREAMING FORWARD ALL IN ONE DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0369 AND WHEN THE SUN SHINES UPON THEM AT THE REQUIRED ANGLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0370 ENTIRE GROVES GLOW AS IF EVERY LEAF WERE BURNISHED SILVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0371 THE FALL OF TROPIC LIGHT ON THE ROYAL CROWN OF A PALM IS A TRULY GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0372 THE FERVID SUN FLOOD BREAKING UPON THE GLOSSY LEAVES IN LONG LANCE RAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0373 LIKE MOUNTAIN WATER AMONG BOULDERS BUT TO ME THERE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPRESSIVE IN THE FALL OF LIGHT UPON THESE SILVER PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0374 IT SEEMS BEATEN TO THE FINEST DUST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0375 AND IS SHED OFF IN MYRIADS OF MINUTE SPARKLES THAT SEEM TO COME FROM THE VERY HEART OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0376 AS IF LIKE RAIN FALLING UPON FERTILE SOIL IT HAD BEEN ABSORBED TO REAPPEAR IN FLOWERS OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0377 THIS SPECIES ALSO GIVES FORTH THE FINEST MUSIC TO THE WIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0378 AFTER LISTENING TO IT IN ALL KINDS OF WINDS NIGHT AND DAY SEASON AFTER SEASON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0379 I THINK I COULD APPROXIMATE TO MY POSITION ON THE MOUNTAINS BY THIS PINE MUSIC ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0380 IF YOU WOULD CATCH THE TONES OF SEPARATE NEEDLES CLIMB A TREE THEY ARE WELL TEMPERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0381 AND GIVE FORTH NO UNCERTAIN SOUND EACH STANDING OUT WITH NO INTERFERENCE EXCEPTING DURING HEAVY GALES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0382 THEN YOU MAY DETECT THE CLICK OF ONE NEEDLE UPON ANOTHER READILY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THEIR FREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0383 WING LIKE HUM SOME IDEA OF THEIR TEMPER MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE FACT THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0384 NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE SO LONG THE VIBRATIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE PECULIAR SHIMMERING OF THE LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0385 ARE MADE AT THE RATE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER MINUTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0386 WHEN A SUGAR PINE AND ONE OF THIS SPECIES EQUAL IN SIZE ARE OBSERVED TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0387 THE LATTER IS SEEN TO BE FAR MORE SIMPLE IN MANNERS MORE LITHELY GRACEFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0388 AND ITS BEAUTY IS OF A KIND MORE EASILY APPRECIATED BUT THEN IT IS ON THE OTHER HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0389 MUCH LESS DIGNIFIED AND ORIGINAL IN DEMEANOR THE SILVER PINE SEEMS EAGER TO SHOOT ALOFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0390 EVEN WHILE IT IS DROWSING IN AUTUMN SUN GOLD YOU MAY STILL DETECT A SKYWARD ASPIRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0391 BUT THE SUGAR PINE SEEMS TOO UNCONSCIOUSLY NOBLE AND TOO COMPLETE IN EVERY WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0392 TO LEAVE ROOM FOR EVEN A HEAVENWARD CARE DOUGLAS SPRUCE PSEUDOTSUGA DOUGLASII
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0393 THIS TREE IS THE KING OF THE SPRUCES AS THE SUGAR PINE IS KING OF PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0394 IT IS BY FAR THE MOST MAJESTIC SPRUCE I EVER BEHELD IN ANY FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0395 AND ONE OF THE LARGEST AND LONGEST LIVED OF THE GIANTS THAT FLOURISH THROUGHOUT THE MAIN PINE BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0396 OFTEN ATTAINING A HEIGHT OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET AND A DIAMETER OF SIX OR SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0397 WHERE THE GROWTH IS NOT TOO CLOSE THE STRONG SPREADING BRANCHES COME MORE THAN HALFWAY DOWN THE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0398 AND THESE ARE HUNG WITH INNUMERABLE SLENDER SWAYING SPRAYS THAT ARE HANDSOMELY FEATHERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0399 WITH THE SHORT LEAVES WHICH RADIATE AT RIGHT ANGLES ALL AROUND THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0400 THIS VIGOROUS SPRUCE IS EVER BEAUTIFUL WELCOMING THE MOUNTAIN WINDS AND THE SNOW AS WELL AS THE MELLOW SUMMER LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0401 AND MAINTAINING ITS YOUTHFUL FRESHNESS UNDIMINISHED FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY THROUGH A THOUSAND STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0402 IT MAKES ITS FINEST APPEARANCE IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY THE RICH BROWN BUDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0403 WITH WHICH ITS SPRAYS ARE TIPPED SWELL AND BREAK ABOUT THIS TIME REVEALING THE YOUNG LEAVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0404 WHICH AT FIRST ARE BRIGHT YELLOW MAKING THE TREE APPEAR AS IF COVERED WITH GAY BLOSSOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0405 WHILE THE PENDULOUS BRACTED CONES WITH THEIR SHELL LIKE SCALES ARE A CONSTANT ADORNMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0406 THE YOUNG TREES ARE MOSTLY GATHERED INTO BEAUTIFUL FAMILY GROUPS EACH SAPLING EXQUISITELY SYMMETRICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0407 THE PRIMARY BRANCHES ARE WHORLED REGULARLY AROUND THE AXIS GENERALLY IN FIVES WHILE EACH IS DRAPED WITH LONG FEATHERY SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0408 THAT DESCEND IN CURVES AS FREE AND AS FINELY DRAWN AS THOSE OF FALLING WATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0409 IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON IT GROWS IN DENSE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0410 GROWING TALL AND MAST LIKE TO A HEIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0411 AND IS GREATLY PRIZED AS A LUMBER TREE BUT IN THE SIERRA IT IS SCATTERED AMONG OTHER TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0412 OR FORMS SMALL GROVES SELDOM ASCENDING HIGHER THAN FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0413 AND NEVER MAKING WHAT WOULD BE CALLED A FOREST IT IS NOT PARTICULAR IN ITS CHOICE OF SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0414 WET OR DRY SMOOTH OR ROCKY IT MAKES OUT TO LIVE WELL ON THEM ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0415 TWO OF THE LARGEST SPECIMENS I HAVE MEASURED ARE IN YOSEMITE VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0416 ONE OF WHICH IS MORE THAN EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0417 AND IS GROWING UPON THE TERMINAL MORAINE OF THE RESIDUAL GLACIER THAT OCCUPIED THE SOUTH FORK CANON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0418 THE OTHER IS NEARLY AS LARGE GROWING UPON ANGULAR BLOCKS OF GRANITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0419 THAT HAVE BEEN SHAKEN FROM THE PRECIPITOUS FRONT OF THE LIBERTY CAP NEAR THE NEVADA FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0420 NO OTHER TREE SEEMS SO CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO EARTHQUAKE TALUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0421 AND MANY OF THESE ROUGH BOULDER SLOPES ARE OCCUPIED BY IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0422 ESPECIALLY IN YOSEMITE GORGES MOISTENED BY THE SPRAY OF WATERFALLS INCENSE CEDAR LIBOCEDRUS DECURRENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0423 THE INCENSE CEDAR IS ANOTHER OF THE GIANTS QUITE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0424 WITHOUT EXCLUSIVELY OCCUPYING ANY CONSIDERABLE AREA OR EVEN MAKING EXTENSIVE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0425 IT ASCENDS TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ON THE WARMER HILLSIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0426 AND REACHES THE CLIMATE MOST CONGENIAL TO IT AT ABOUT FROM THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0427 GROWING VIGOROUSLY AT THIS ELEVATION ON ALL KINDS OF SOIL AND IN PARTICULAR IT IS CAPABLE OF ENDURING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0428 MORE MOISTURE ABOUT ITS ROOTS THAN ANY OF ITS COMPANIONS EXCEPTING ONLY THE SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0429 THE LARGEST SPECIMENS ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH AND SEVEN FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0430 THE BARK IS BROWN OF A SINGULARLY RICH TONE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO ARTISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0431 AND THE FOLIAGE IS TINTED WITH A WARMER YELLOW THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER EVERGREEN IN THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0432 CASTING YOUR EYE OVER THE GENERAL FOREST FROM SOME RIDGE TOP THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0433 COLOR ALONE OF ITS SPIRY SUMMITS IS SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY IT IN ANY COMPANY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0434 YOUTH SAY UP TO THE AGE OF SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0435 NO OTHER TREE FORMS SO STRICTLY TAPERED A CONE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0436 THE BRANCHES SWOOP OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD IN BOLD CURVES EXCEPTING THE YOUNGER ONES NEAR THE TOP
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0437 WHICH ASPIRE WHILE THE LOWEST DROOP TO THE GROUND AND ALL SPREAD OUT IN FLAT FERNY PLUMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0438 BEAUTIFULLY FRONDED AND IMBRICATED UPON ONE ANOTHER AS IT BECOMES OLDER IT GROWS STRIKINGLY IRREGULAR AND PICTURESQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0439 LARGE SPECIAL BRANCHES PUT OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM THE TRUNK FORM BIG STUBBORN ELBOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0440 AND THEN SHOOT UP PARALLEL WITH THE AXIS VERY OLD TREES ARE USUALLY DEAD AT THE TOP
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0441 THE MAIN AXIS PROTRUDING ABOVE AMPLE MASSES OF GREEN PLUMES GRAY AND LICHEN COVERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0442 AND DRILLED FULL OF ACORN HOLES BY THE WOODPECKERS THE PLUMES ARE EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0443 NO WAVING FERN FROND IN SHADY DELL IS MORE UNRESERVEDLY BEAUTIFUL IN FORM AND TEXTURE OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0444 HALF SO INSPIRING IN COLOR AND SPICY FRAGRANCE IN ITS PRIME THE WHOLE TREE IS THATCHED WITH THEM SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0445 THAT THEY SHED OFF RAIN AND SNOW LIKE A ROOF MAKING FINE MANSIONS FOR STORM BOUND BIRDS AND MOUNTAINEERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0446 BUT IF YOU WOULD SEE THE LIBOCEDRUS IN ALL ITS GLORY YOU MUST GO TO THE WOODS IN WINTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0447 THEN IT IS LADEN WITH MYRIADS OF FOUR SIDED STAMINATE CONES ABOUT THE SIZE OF WHEAT GRAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0448 WINTER WHEAT PRODUCING A GOLDEN TINGE AND FORMING A NOBLE ILLUSTRATION OF NATURE'S IMMORTAL VIGOR AND VIRILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0449 THE FERTILE CONES ARE ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF AN INCH LONG BORNE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLUMY BRANCHLETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0450 WHERE THEY SERVE TO ENRICH STILL MORE THE SURPASSING BEAUTY OF THIS GRAND WINTER BLOOMING GOLDENROD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0451 WHITE SILVER FIR ABIES CONCOLOR WE COME NOW TO THE MOST REGULARLY PLANTED OF ALL THE MAIN FOREST BELTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0452 COMPOSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF TWO NOBLE FIRS A CONCOLOR AND A MAGNIFICA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0453 IT EXTENDS WITH NO MARKED INTERRUPTION FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0454 AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIVE THOUSAND TO NEARLY NINE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0455 IN ITS YOUTH A CONCOLOR IS A CHARMINGLY SYMMETRICAL TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0456 WITH BRANCHES REGULARLY WHORLED IN LEVEL COLLARS AROUND ITS WHITISH GRAY AXIS WHICH TERMINATES IN A STRONG
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0457 HOPEFUL SHOOT THE LEAVES ARE IN TWO HORIZONTAL ROWS ALONG BRANCHLETS THAT COMMONLY ARE LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0458 FORMING HANDSOME PLUMES PINNATED LIKE THE FRONDS OF FERNS THE CONES ARE GRAYISH GREEN WHEN RIPE CYLINDRICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0459 ABOUT FROM THREE TO FOUR INCHES LONG BY ONE AND A HALF TO TWO INCHES WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0460 AND STAND UPRIGHT ON THE UPPER BRANCHES FULL GROWN TREES FAVORABLY SITUATED AS TO SOIL AND EXPOSURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0461 ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0462 THOUGH LARGER SPECIMENS ARE BY NO MEANS RARE AS OLD AGE CREEPS ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0463 THE BARK BECOMES ROUGHER AND GRAYER THE BRANCHES LOSE THEIR EXACT REGULARITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0464 MANY ARE SNOW BENT OR BROKEN OFF AND THE MAIN AXIS OFTEN BECOMES DOUBLE OR OTHERWISE IRREGULAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0465 FROM ACCIDENTS TO THE TERMINAL BUD OR SHOOT BUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF ITS LIFE ON THE MOUNTAINS COME WHAT MAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0466 THE NOBLE GRANDEUR OF THE SPECIES IS PATENT TO EVERY EYE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR OR RED FIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0467 ABIES MAGNIFICA THIS IS THE MOST CHARMINGLY SYMMETRICAL OF ALL THE GIANTS OF THE SIERRA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0468 FAR SURPASSING ITS COMPANION SPECIES IN THIS RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0469 AND EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM IT BY THE PURPLISH RED BARK WHICH IS ALSO MORE CLOSELY FURROWED THAN THAT OF THE WHITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0470 AND BY ITS LARGER CONES MORE REGULARLY WHORLED AND FRONDED BRANCHES AND BY ITS LEAVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0471 WHICH ARE SHORTER AND GROW ALL AROUND THE BRANCHLETS AND POINT UPWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0472 IN SIZE THESE TWO SILVER FIRS ARE ABOUT EQUAL THE MAGNIFICA PERHAPS A LITTLE THE TALLER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0473 SPECIMENS FROM TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH ARE NOT RARE ON WELL GROUND MORAINE SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0474 AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0475 THE LARGEST THAT I MEASURED STANDS BACK THREE MILES FROM THE BRINK OF THE NORTH WALL OF YOSEMITE VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0476 FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0477 A DIAMETER OF A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0478 HAPPY THE MAN WITH THE FREEDOM AND THE LOVE TO CLIMB ONE OF THESE SUPERB TREES IN FULL FLOWER AND FRUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0479 HOW ADMIRABLE THE FOREST WORK OF NATURE IS THEN SEEN TO BE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0480 AS ONE MAKES HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE BROAD FRONDED BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0481 ALL ARRANGED IN EXQUISITE ORDER AROUND THE TRUNK LIKE THE WHORLED LEAVES OF LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0482 AND EACH BRANCH AND BRANCHLET ABOUT AS STRICTLY PINNATE AS THE MOST SYMMETRICAL FERN FROND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0483 THE STAMINATE CONES ARE SEEN GROWING STRAIGHT DOWNWARD FROM THE UNDER SIDE OF THE YOUNG BRANCHES IN LAVISH PROFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0484 MAKING FINE PURPLE CLUSTERS AMID THE GRAYISH GREEN FOLIAGE ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0485 THE TOPMOST BRANCHES THE FERTILE CONES ARE SET FIRMLY ON END LIKE SMALL CASKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0486 THEY ARE ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG THREE WIDE COVERED WITH A FINE GRAY DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0487 AND STREAKED WITH CRYSTAL BALSAM THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN POURED UPON EACH CONE FROM ABOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0488 BOTH THE SILVER FIRS LIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OR MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0489 WHEN THE CONDITIONS ABOUT THEM ARE AT ALL FAVORABLE SOME VENERABLE PATRIARCH MAY OFTEN BE SEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0490 HEAVILY STORM MARKED TOWERING IN SEVERE MAJESTY ABOVE THE RISING GENERATION WITH A PROTECTING GROVE OF SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0491 PRESSING CLOSE AROUND HIS FEET EACH DRESSED WITH SUCH LOVING CARE THAT NOT A LEAF SEEMS WANTING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0492 OTHER COMPANIES ARE MADE UP OF TREES NEAR THE PRIME OF LIFE EXQUISITELY HARMONIZED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0493 TO ONE ANOTHER IN FORM AND GESTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0494 AS IF NATURE HAD CULLED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH NICE DISCRIMINATION FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0495 IT IS FROM THIS TREE CALLED RED FIR BY THE LUMBERMAN THAT MOUNTAINEERS ALWAYS CUT BOUGHS TO SLEEP ON WHEN THEY ARE SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE WITHIN ITS LIMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0496 TWO ROWS OF THE PLUSHY BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0497 OVERLAPPING ALONG THE MIDDLE AND A CRESCENT OF SMALLER PLUMES MIXED WITH FERNS AND FLOWERS FOR A PILLOW FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0498 THE VERY BEST BED IMAGINABLE THE ESSENCES OF THE PRESSED LEAVES SEEM TO FILL EVERY PORE OF ONE'S BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0499 THE SOUNDS OF FALLING WATER MAKE A SOOTHING HUSH WHILE THE SPACES BETWEEN THE GRAND SPIRES AFFORD NOBLE OPENINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0500 THROUGH WHICH TO GAZE DREAMILY INTO THE STARRY SKY EVEN IN THE MATTER OF SENSUOUS EASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0501 ANY COMBINATION OF CLOTH STEEL SPRINGS AND FEATHERS SEEMS VULGAR IN COMPARISON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0502 THE FIR WOODS ARE DELIGHTFUL SAUNTERING GROUNDS AT ANY TIME OF YEAR BUT MOST SO IN AUTUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0503 THEN THE NOBLE TREES ARE HUSHED IN THE HAZY LIGHT AND DRIP WITH BALSAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0504 THE CONES ARE RIPE AND THE SEEDS WITH THEIR AMPLE PURPLE WINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0505 MOTTLE THE AIR LIKE FLOCKS OF BUTTERFLIES WHILE DEER FEEDING IN THE FLOWERY OPENINGS BETWEEN THE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0506 AND BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS IN THE BRANCHES MAKE A PLEASANT STIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0507 WHICH ENRICHES THE DEEP BROODING CALM OF THE WILDERNESS AND GIVES A PECULIAR IMPRESSIVENESS TO EVERY TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0508 NO WONDER THE ENTHUSIASTIC DOUGLAS WENT WILD WITH JOY WHEN HE FIRST DISCOVERED THIS SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0509 EVEN IN THE SIERRA WHERE SO MANY NOBLE EVERGREENS CHALLENGE ADMIRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0510 WE LINGER AMONG THESE COLOSSAL FIRS WITH FRESH LOVE AND EXTOL THEIR BEAUTY AGAIN AND AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0511 AS IF NO OTHER IN THE WORLD COULD HENCEFORTH CLAIM OUR REGARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0512 IT IS IN THESE WOODS THE GREAT GRANITE DOMES RISE THAT ARE SO STRIKING AND CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE OF THE SIERRA AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0513 HERE TOO WE FIND THE BEST OF THE GARDEN MEADOWS THEY LIE LEVEL ON THE TOPS OF THE DIVIDING RIDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0514 OR SLOPING ON THE SIDES OF THEM EMBEDDED IN THE MAGNIFICENT FOREST SOME OF THESE MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0515 ARE IN GREAT PART OCCUPIED BY VERATRUMALBA WHICH HERE GROWS RANK AND TALL

knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0517 COLUMBINE GROWS ON THE DRIER MARGINS WITH TALL LARKSPURS AND LUPINES WAIST DEEP IN GRASSES AND SEDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0518 SEVERAL SPECIES OF CASTILLEIA ALSO MAKE A BRIGHT SHOW IN BEDS OF BLUE AND WHITE VIOLETS AND DAISIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0519 BUT THE GLORY OF THESE FOREST MEADOWS IS A LILY L PARVUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0520 THE FLOWERS ARE ORANGE COLORED AND QUITE SMALL THE SMALLEST I EVER SAW OF THE TRUE LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0521 BUT IT IS SHOWY NEVERTHELESS FOR IT IS SEVEN TO EIGHT FEET HIGH AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0522 WAVES MAGNIFICENT RACEMES OF TEN TO TWENTY FLOWERS OR MORE OVER ONE'S HEAD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0523 WHILE IT STANDS OUT IN THE OPEN GROUND WITH JUST ENOUGH OF GRASS AND OTHER PLANTS ABOUT IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0524 TO MAKE A FRINGE FOR ITS FEET AND SHOW IT OFF TO BEST ADVANTAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0525 A DRY SPOT A LITTLE WAY BACK FROM THE MARGIN OF A SILVER FIR LILY GARDEN MAKES A GLORIOUS CAMPGROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0526 ESPECIALLY WHERE THE SLOPE IS TOWARD THE EAST AND OPENS A VIEW OF THE DISTANT PEAKS ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0527 THE TALL LILIES ARE BROUGHT FORWARD IN ALL THEIR GLORY BY THE LIGHT OF YOUR BLAZING CAMP FIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0528 RELIEVED AGAINST THE OUTER DARKNESS AND THE NEAREST OF THE TREES WITH THEIR WHORLED BRANCHES TOWER ABOVE YOU LIKE LARGER LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0529 AND THE SKY SEEN THROUGH THE GARDEN OPENING SEEMS ONE VAST MEADOW OF WHITE LILY STARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0530 IN THE MORNING EVERYTHING IS JOYOUS AND BRIGHT THE DELICIOUS PURPLE OF THE DAWN CHANGES SOFTLY TO DAFFODIL YELLOW AND WHITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0531 WHILE THE SUNBEAMS POURING THROUGH THE PASSES BETWEEN THE PEAKS GIVE A MARGIN OF GOLD TO EACH OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0532 THEN THE SPIRES OF THE FIRS IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE MIDDLE REGION CATCH THE GLOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0533 AND YOUR CAMP GROVE IS FILLED WITH LIGHT THE BIRDS BEGIN TO STIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0534 SEEKING SUNNY BRANCHES ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW FOR SUN BATHS AFTER THE COLD NIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0535 AND LOOKING FOR THEIR BREAKFASTS EVERY ONE OF THEM AS FRESH AS A LILY AND AS CHARMINGLY ARRAYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn/wav/mtn0536 INNUMERABLE INSECTS BEGIN TO DANCE THE DEER WITHDRAW FROM THE OPEN GLADES AND RIDGE TOPS TO THEIR LEAFY HIDING PLACES IN THE CHAPARRAL

knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0004 THE FORESTS PART TWO BIG TREE SEQUOIA GIGANTEA BETWEEN THE HEAVY PINE AND SILVER FIR BELTS WE FIND THE BIG TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0005 THE KING OF ALL THE CONIFERS IN THE WORLD THE NOBLEST OF A NOBLE RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0006 IT EXTENDS IN A WIDELY INTERRUPTED BELT FROM A SMALL GROVE ON THE MIDDLE FORK OF THE AMERICAN RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0007 TO THE HEAD OF DEER CREEK A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0008 THE NORTHERN LIMIT BEING NEAR THE THIRTY NINTH PARALLEL THE SOUTHERN A LITTLE BELOW THE THIRTY SIXTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0009 AND THE ELEVATION OF THE BELT ABOVE THE SEA VARIES FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0010 FROM THE AMERICAN RIVER GROVE TO THE FOREST ON KING'S RIVER THE SPECIES OCCURS ONLY IN SMALL ISOLATED GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0011 SO SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE BELT THAT THREE OF THE GAPS IN IT ARE FROM FORTY TO SIXTY MILES WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0012 BUT FROM KING'S RIVER SOUTHWARD THE SEQUOIA IS NOT RESTRICTED TO MERE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0013 BUT EXTENDS ACROSS THE BROAD RUGGED BASINS OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE RIVERS IN NOBLE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0014 A DISTANCE OF NEARLY SEVENTY MILES THE CONTINUITY OF THIS PART OF THE BELT BEING BROKEN ONLY BY DEEP CANONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0015 THE FRESNO THE LARGEST OF THE NORTHERN GROVES OCCUPIES AN AREA OF THREE OR FOUR SQUARE MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0016 A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE FAMOUS MARIPOSA GROVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0017 ALONG THE BEVELED RIM OF THE CANON OF THE SOUTH FORK OF KING'S RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0018 THERE IS A MAJESTIC FOREST OF SEQUOIA ABOUT SIX MILES LONG BY TWO WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0019 THIS IS THE NORTHERNMOST ASSEMBLAGE OF BIG TREES THAT MAY FAIRLY BE CALLED A FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0020 DESCENDING THE PRECIPITOUS DIVIDE BETWEEN THE KING'S RIVER AND KAWEAH YOU ENTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0021 THE GRAND FORESTS THAT FORM THE MAIN CONTINUOUS PORTION OF THE BELT ADVANCING SOUTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0022 THE GIANTS BECOME MORE AND MORE IRREPRESSIBLY EXUBERANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0023 HEAVING THEIR MASSIVE CROWNS INTO THE SKY FROM EVERY RIDGE AND SLOPE AND WAVING ONWARD IN GRACEFUL COMPLIANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0024 WITH THE COMPLICATED TOPOGRAPHY OF THE REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0025 THE FINEST OF THE KAWEAH SECTION OF THE BELT IS ON THE BROAD RIDGE BETWEEN MARBLE CREEK AND THE MIDDLE FORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0026 AND EXTENDS FROM THE GRANITE HEADLANDS OVERLOOKING THE HOT PLAINS TO WITHIN A FEW MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0027 OF THE COOL GLACIAL FOUNTAINS OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0028 THE EXTREME UPPER LIMIT OF THE BELT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND SOUTH FORKS OF THE KAWEAH AT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0029 AN ELEVATION OF EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED FEET BUT THE FINEST BLOCK OF BIG TREE FOREST IN THE ENTIRE BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0030 IS ON THE NORTH FORK OF TULE RIVER IN THE NORTHERN GROVES THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW YOUNG TREES OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0031 BUT HERE FOR EVERY OLD STORM STRICKEN GIANT THERE ARE MANY IN ALL THE GLORY OF PRIME VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0032 AND FOR EACH OF THESE A CROWD OF EAGER HOPEFUL YOUNG TREES AND SAPLINGS GROWING HEARTILY ON MORAINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0033 ROCKY LEDGES ALONG WATERCOURSES AND IN THE MOIST ALLUVIUM OF MEADOWS SEEMINGLY IN HOT PURSUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0034 OF ETERNAL LIFE BUT THOUGH THE AREA OCCUPIED BY THE SPECIES INCREASES SO MUCH FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0035 THERE IS NO MARKED INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0036 A HEIGHT OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0037 AND A DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND OF ABOUT TWENTY FEET IS PERHAPS ABOUT THE AVERAGE SIZE OF FULL GROWN TREES FAVORABLY SITUATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0038 SPECIMENS TWENTY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER ARE NOT VERY RARE AND A FEW ARE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0039 THE CALAVERAS GROVE THERE ARE FOUR TREES OVER THREE HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0040 THE TALLEST OF WHICH BY CAREFUL MEASUREMENT IS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0041 THE LARGEST I HAVE YET MET IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0042 IS A MAJESTIC OLD SCARRED MONUMENT IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0043 IT IS THIRTY FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER INSIDE THE BARK FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0044 UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS THESE GIANTS PROBABLY LIVE FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE THOUGH FEW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0045 OF EVEN THE LARGER TREES ARE MORE THAN HALF AS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0046 I NEVER SAW A BIG TREE THAT HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0047 BARRING ACCIDENTS THEY SEEM TO BE IMMORTAL BEING EXEMPT FROM ALL THE DISEASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0048 THAT AFFLICT AND KILL OTHER TREES UNLESS DESTROYED BY MAN THEY LIVE ON INDEFINITELY UNTIL BURNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0049 SMASHED BY LIGHTNING OR CAST DOWN BY STORMS OR BY THE GIVING WAY OF THE GROUND ON WHICH THEY STAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0050 THE AGE OF ONE THAT WAS FELLED IN THE CALAVERAS GROVE FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING ITS STUMP FOR A DANCING FLOOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0051 WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AND ITS DIAMETER MEASURED ACROSS THE STUMP TWENTY FOUR FEET INSIDE THE BARK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0052 ANOTHER THAT WAS CUT DOWN IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0053 BUT NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS OLDER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS THOUGH NOT A VERY OLD LOOKING TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0054 IT WAS FELLED TO PROCURE A SECTION FOR EXHIBITION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0055 THUS AN OPPORTUNITY WAS GIVEN TO COUNT ITS ANNUAL RINGS OF GROWTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0056 THE COLOSSAL SCARRED MONUMENT IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST MENTIONED ABOVE IS BURNED HALF THROUGH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0057 AND I SPENT A DAY IN MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF ITS AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0058 CLEARING AWAY THE CHARRED SURFACE WITH AN AX AND CAREFULLY COUNTING THE ANNUAL RINGS WITH THE AID OF A POCKET LENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0059 THE WOOD RINGS IN THE SECTION I LAID BARE WERE SO INVOLVED AND CONTORTED IN SOME PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0060 THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS AGE EXACTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0061 BUT I COUNTED OVER FOUR THOUSAND RINGS WHICH SHOWED THAT THIS TREE WAS IN ITS PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0062 SWAYING IN THE SIERRA WINDS WHEN CHRIST WALKED THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0063 NO OTHER TREE IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS I KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0064 HAS LOOKED DOWN ON SO MANY CENTURIES AS THE SEQUOIA OR OPENS SUCH IMPRESSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE VIEWS INTO HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0065 SO EXQUISITELY HARMONIOUS AND FINELY BALANCED ARE EVEN THE VERY MIGHTIEST OF THESE MONARCHS OF THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0066 IN ALL THEIR PROPORTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THERE NEVER IS ANYTHING OVERGROWN OR MONSTROUS LOOKING ABOUT THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0067 ON COMING IN SIGHT OF THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE LIKELY TO SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0068 OH SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL NOBLE LOOKING TREES ARE TOWERING THERE AMONG THE FIRS AND PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0069 THEIR GRANDEUR BEING IN THE MEAN TIME IN GREAT PART INVISIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0070 BUT TO THE LIVING EYE IT WILL BE MANIFESTED SOONER OR LATER STEALING SLOWLY ON THE SENSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0071 LIKE THE GRANDEUR OF NIAGARA OR THE LOFTY YOSEMITE DOMES THEIR GREAT SIZE IS HIDDEN FROM THE INEXPERIENCED OBSERVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0072 AS LONG AS THEY ARE SEEN AT A DISTANCE IN ONE HARMONIOUS VIEW WHEN HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0073 YOU APPROACH THEM AND WALK ROUND THEM YOU BEGIN TO WONDER AT THEIR COLOSSAL SIZE AND SEEK A MEASURING ROD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0074 THESE GIANTS BULGE CONSIDERABLY AT THE BASE BUT NOT MORE THAN IS REQUIRED FOR BEAUTY AND SAFETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0075 AND THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS BULGING SEEMS IN SOME CASES EXCESSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0076 IS THAT ONLY A COMPARATIVELY SMALL SECTION OF THE SHAFT IS SEEN AT ONCE IN NEAR VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0077 ONE THAT I MEASURED IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST WAS TWENTY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0078 AND TEN FEET IN DIAMETER TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0079 SHOWING THAT THE TAPER OF THE TRUNK AS A WHOLE IS CHARMINGLY FINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0080 AND WHEN YOU STAND BACK FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE MASSIVE COLUMNS FROM THE SWELLING INSTEP
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0081 TO THE LOFTY SUMMIT DISSOLVING IN A DOME OF VERDURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0082 YOU REJOICE IN THE UNRIVALED DISPLAY OF COMBINED GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0083 ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET OR MORE OF THE TRUNK IS USUALLY BRANCHLESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0084 BUT ITS MASSIVE SIMPLICITY IS RELIEVED BY THE BARK FURROWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0085 WHICH INSTEAD OF MAKING AN IRREGULAR NETWORK RUN EVENLY PARALLEL LIKE THE FLUTING OF AN ARCHITECTURAL COLUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0086 AND TO SOME EXTENT BY TUFTS OF SLENDER SPRAYS THAT WAVE LIGHTLY IN THE WINDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0087 AND CAST FLECKS OF SHADE SEEMING TO HAVE BEEN PINNED ON HERE AND THERE FOR THE SAKE OF BEAUTY ONLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0088 THE YOUNG TREES HAVE SLENDER SIMPLE BRANCHES DOWN TO THE GROUND PUT ON WITH STRICT REGULARITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0089 SHARPLY ASPIRING AT THE TOP HORIZONTAL ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN AND DROOPING IN HANDSOME CURVES AT THE BASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0090 BY THE TIME THE SAPLING IS FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS OLD THIS SPIRY FEATHERY JUVENILE HABIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0091 MERGES INTO THE FIRM ROUNDED DOME FORM OF MIDDLE AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0092 WHICH IN TURN TAKES ON THE ECCENTRIC PICTURESQUENESS OF OLD AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0093 NO OTHER TREE IN THE SIERRA FOREST HAS FOLIAGE SO DENSELY MASSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0094 OR PRESENTS OUTLINES SO FIRMLY DRAWN AND SO STEADILY SUBORDINATE TO A SPECIAL TYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0095 A KNOTTY UNGOVERNABLE LOOKING BRANCH FIVE TO EIGHT FEET THICK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0096 MAY BE SEEN PUSHING OUT ABRUPTLY FROM THE SMOOTH TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0097 AS IF SURE TO THROW THE REGULAR CURVE INTO CONFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0098 BUT AS SOON AS THE GENERAL OUTLINE IS REACHED IT STOPS SHORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0099 AND DISSOLVES IN SPREADING BOSSES OF LAW ABIDING SPRAYS JUST AS IF EVERY TREE WERE GROWING BENEATH SOME HUGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0100 INVISIBLE BELL GLASS AGAINST WHOSE SIDES EVERY BRANCH WAS BEING PRESSED AND MOLDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0101 YET SOMEHOW INDULGING IN SO MANY SMALL DEPARTURES FROM THE REGULAR FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0102 THAT THERE IS STILL AN APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM THE FOLIAGE OF THE SAPLINGS IS DARK BLUISH GREEN IN COLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0103 WHILE THE OLDER TREES RIPEN TO A WARM BROWNISH YELLOW TINT LIKE LIBOCEDRUS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0104 BARK IS RICH CINNAMON BROWN PURPLISH IN YOUNG TREES AND IN SHADY PORTIONS OF THE OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0105 WHILE THE GROUND IS COVERED WITH BROWN LEAVES AND BURS FORMING COLOR MASSES OF EXTRAORDINARY RICHNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0106 NOT TO MENTION THE FLOWERS AND UNDERBRUSH THAT REJOICE ABOUT THEM IN THEIR SEASONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0107 WALK THE SEQUOIA WOODS AT ANY TIME OF YEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0108 AND YOU WILL SAY THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MAJESTIC ON EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0109 BEAUTIFUL AND IMPRESSIVE CONTRASTS MEET YOU EVERYWHERE THE COLORS OF TREE AND FLOWER ROCK AND SKY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0110 LIGHT AND SHADE STRENGTH AND FRAILTY ENDURANCE AND EVANESCENCE TANGLES OF SUPPLE HAZEL BUSHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0111 TREE PILLARS ABOUT AS RIGID AS GRANITE DOMES ROSES AND VIOLETS THE SMALLEST OF THEIR KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0112 BLOOMING AROUND THE FEET OF THE GIANTS AND RUGS OF THE LOWLY CHAMAEBATIA WHERE THE SUNBEAMS FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0113 THEN IN WINTER THE TREES THEMSELVES BREAK FORTH IN BLOOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0114 MYRIADS OF SMALL FOUR SIDED STAMINATE CONES CROWD THE ENDS OF THE SLENDER SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0115 COLORING THE WHOLE TREE AND WHEN RIPE DUSTING THE AIR AND THE GROUND WITH GOLDEN POLLEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0116 THE FERTILE CONES ARE BRIGHT GRASS GREEN MEASURING ABOUT TWO INCHES IN LENGTH BY ONE AND A HALF IN THICKNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0118 WITH FROM FIVE TO EIGHT SEEDS AT THE BASE OF EACH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0119 A SINGLE CONE THEREFORE CONTAINS FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0120 WHICH ARE ABOUT A FOURTH OF AN INCH LONG BY THREE SIXTEENTHS WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0121 INCLUDING A THIN FLAT MARGIN THAT MAKES THEM GO GLANCING AND WAVERING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0122 IN THEIR FALL LIKE A BOY'S KITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0123 THE FRUITFULNESS OF SEQUOIA MAY BE ILLUSTRATED BY TWO SPECIMEN BRANCHES ONE AND A HALF AND TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0124 ON WHICH I COUNTED FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CONES NO OTHER SIERRA CONIFER PRODUCES NEARLY SO MANY SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0125 MILLIONS ARE RIPENED ANNUALLY BY A SINGLE TREE AND IN A FRUITFUL YEAR THE PRODUCT OF ONE OF THE NORTHERN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0126 WOULD BE ENOUGH TO PLANT ALL THE MOUNTAIN RANGES OF THE WORLD NATURE TAKES CARE HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0127 THAT NOT ONE SEED IN A MILLION SHALL GERMINATE AT ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0128 AND OF THOSE THAT DO PERHAPS NOT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND IS SUFFERED TO LIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0129 THROUGH THE MANY VICISSITUDES OF STORM DROUGHT FIRE AND SNOW CRUSHING THAT BESET THEIR YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0130 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL IS THE HAPPY HARVESTER OF MOST OF THE SEQUOIA CONES OUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0131 OF EVERY HUNDRED PERHAPS NINETY FALL TO HIS SHARE AND UNLESS CUT OFF BY HIS IVORY SICKLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0132 THEY SHAKE OUT THEIR SEEDS AND REMAIN ON THE TREE FOR MANY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0133 WATCHING THE SQUIRRELS AT THEIR HARVEST WORK IN THE INDIAN SUMMER IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL DIVERSIONS IMAGINABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0134 THE WOODS ARE CALM AND THE RIPE COLORS ARE BLAZING IN ALL THEIR GLORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0135 THE CONE LADEN TREES STAND MOTIONLESS IN THE WARM HAZY AIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0136 AND YOU MAY SEE THE CRIMSON CRESTED WOODCOCK THE PRINCE OF SIERRA WOODPECKERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0137 DRILLING SOME DEAD LIMB OR FALLEN TRUNK WITH HIS BILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0138 AND EVER AND ANON FILLING THE GLENS WITH HIS HAPPY CACKLE THE HUMMING BIRD TOO
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0139 DWELLS IN THESE NOBLE WOODS AND MAY OFTENTIMES BE SEEN GLANCING AMONG THE FLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0140 OR RESTING WING WEARY ON SOME LEAFLESS TWIG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0141 HERE ALSO ARE THE FAMILIAR ROBIN OF THE ORCHARDS AND THE BROWN AND GRIZZLY BEARS SO OBVIOUSLY FITTED FOR THESE MAJESTIC SOLITUDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0142 AND THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL MAKING MORE HILARIOUS EXUBERANT VITAL STIR THAN ALL THE BEARS BIRDS AND HUMMING WINGS TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0143 AS SOON AS ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENS TO THE CROWN OF THESE SEQUOIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0144 SUCH AS BEING STRICKEN OFF BY LIGHTNING OR BROKEN BY STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0145 THEN THE BRANCHES BENEATH THE WOUND NO MATTER HOW SITUATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0146 SEEM TO BE EXCITED LIKE A COLONY OF BEES THAT HAVE LOST THEIR QUEEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0147 BECOME ANXIOUS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE LIMBS THAT HAVE GROWN OUTWARD FOR CENTURIES AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0148 BEGIN TO TURN UPWARD TO ASSIST IN MAKING A NEW CROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0149 EACH SPEEDILY ASSUMING THE SPECIAL FORM OF TRUE SUMMITS EVEN IN THE CASE OF MERE STUMPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0150 BURNED HALF THROUGH SOME MERE ORNAMENTAL TUFT WILL TRY TO GO ALOFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0151 AND DO ITS BEST AS A LEADER IN FORMING A NEW HEAD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0152 GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE OF THESE GRAND TREES ARE OFTEN FOUND STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0153 THE SEEDS FROM WHICH THEY SPRANG HAVING PROBABLY GROWN ON GROUND CLEARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0154 BY THE FALL OF A LARGE TREE OF A FORMER GENERATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0155 THESE PATCHES OF FRESH MELLOW SOIL BESIDE THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF THE FALLEN GIANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0156 MAY BE FROM FORTY TO SIXTY FEET WIDE AND THEY ARE SPEEDILY OCCUPIED BY SEEDLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0157 OUT OF THESE SEEDLING THICKETS PERHAPS TWO OR THREE MAY BECOME TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0158 FORMING THOSE CLOSE GROUPS CALLED THREE GRACES LOVING COUPLES ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0159 FOR EVEN SUPPOSING THAT THE TREES SHOULD STAND TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET APART WHILE YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0160 BY THE TIME THEY ARE FULL GROWN THEIR TRUNKS WILL TOUCH AND CROWD AGAINST EACH OTHER AND EVEN APPEAR AS ONE IN SOME CASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0161 IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT THIS GRAND SEQUOIA WAS ONCE FAR MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED OVER THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0162 BUT AFTER LONG AND CAREFUL STUDY I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT NEVER WAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0163 AT LEAST SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD BECAUSE A DILIGENT SEARCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0164 ALONG THE MARGINS OF THE GROVES AND IN THE GAPS BETWEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0165 FAILS TO REVEAL A SINGLE TRACE OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE BEYOND ITS PRESENT BOUNDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0166 NOTWITHSTANDING I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IF EVERY SEQUOIA IN THE RANGE WERE TO DIE TO DAY NUMEROUS MONUMENTS OF THEIR EXISTENCE WOULD REMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0167 OF SO IMPERISHABLE A NATURE AS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE STUDENT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND YEARS HENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0168 IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MIGHT NOTICE THAT NO SPECIES OF CONIFEROUS TREE IN THE RANGE KEEPS ITS INDIVIDUALS SO WELL TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0169 AS SEQUOIA A MILE IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF ANY STRAGGLER FROM THE MAIN BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0170 AND ALL OF THOSE STRAGGLERS THAT HAVE COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION ARE YOUNG INSTEAD OF OLD MONUMENTAL TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0171 RELICS OF A MORE EXTENDED GROWTH AGAIN SEQUOIA TRUNKS FREQUENTLY ENDURE FOR CENTURIES AFTER THEY FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0172 I HAVE A SPECIMEN BLOCK CUT FROM A FALLEN TRUNK WHICH IS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM SPECIMENS CUT FROM LIVING TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0173 ALTHOUGH THE OLD TRUNK FRAGMENT FROM WHICH IT WAS DERIVED HAS LAIN IN THE DAMP FOREST MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0174 PROBABLY THRICE AS LONG THE TIME MEASURE IN THE CASE IS SIMPLY THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0175 WHEN THE PONDEROUS TRUNK TO WHICH THE OLD VESTIGE BELONGED FELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0176 IT SUNK ITSELF INTO THE GROUND THUS MAKING A LONG STRAIGHT DITCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0177 AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DITCH A SILVER FIR IS GROWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0178 THAT IS NOW FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0179 AS DETERMINED BY CUTTING IT HALF THROUGH AND COUNTING THE RINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0180 THUS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE REMNANT OF THE TRUNK THAT MADE THE DITCH HAS LAIN ON THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0181 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0182 FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT TO FIND THE WHOLE TIME WE MUST ADD TO THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0183 THE TIME THAT THE VANISHED PORTION OF THE TRUNK LAY IN THE DITCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0184 BEFORE BEING BURNED OUT OF THE WAY PLUS THE TIME THAT PASSED BEFORE THE SEED FROM WHICH THE MONUMENTAL FIR SPRANG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0185 FELL INTO THE PREPARED SOIL AND TOOK ROOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0186 NOW BECAUSE SEQUOIA TRUNKS ARE NEVER WHOLLY CONSUMED IN ONE FOREST FIRE AND THOSE FIRES RECUR ONLY AT CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0187 BECAUSE SEQUOIA DITCHES AFTER BEING CLEARED ARE OFTEN LEFT UNPLANTED FOR CENTURIES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0188 BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THE TRUNK REMNANT IN QUESTION MAY PROBABLY HAVE LAIN A THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0189 AND THIS INSTANCE IS BY NO MEANS A RARE ONE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0190 ADMITTING THAT UPON THOSE AREAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ONCE COVERED WITH SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0191 EVERY TREE MAY HAVE FALLEN AND EVERY TRUNK MAY HAVE BEEN BURNED OR BURIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0192 LEAVING NOT A REMNANT MANY OF THE DITCHES MADE BY THE FALL OF THE PONDEROUS TRUNKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0193 AND THE BOWLS MADE BY THEIR UPTURNING ROOTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0194 WOULD REMAIN PATENT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AFTER THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE TRUNKS THAT MADE THEM HAD VANISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0195 MUCH OF THIS DITCH WRITING WOULD NO DOUBT BE QUICKLY EFFACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0196 BY THE FLOOD ACTION OF OVERFLOWING STREAMS AND RAIN WASHING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0197 BUT NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION WOULD REMAIN ENDURINGLY ENGRAVED ON RIDGE TOPS BEYOND SUCH DESTRUCTIVE ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0198 FOR WHERE ALL THE CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE IT IS ALMOST IMPERISHABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0199 NOW THESE HISTORIC DITCHES AND ROOT BOWLS OCCUR IN ALL THE PRESENT SEQUOIA GROVES AND FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0200 BUT AS FAR AS I HAVE OBSERVED NOT THE FAINTEST VESTIGE OF ONE PRESENTS ITSELF OUTSIDE OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0201 WE THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE AREA COVERED BY SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0202 HAS NOT BEEN DIMINISHED DURING THE LAST EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND YEARS AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0203 PROBABLY NOT AT ALL IN POST GLACIAL TIMES IS THE SPECIES VERGING TO EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0204 WHAT ARE ITS RELATIONS TO CLIMATE SOIL AND ASSOCIATED TREES ALL THE PHENOMENA BEARING ON THESE QUESTIONS ALSO THROW LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0205 AS WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO SHOW UPON THE PECULIAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0206 AND SUSTAIN THE CONCLUSION ALREADY ARRIVED AT ON THE QUESTION OF EXTENSION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0207 THE NORTHERN GROUPS AS WE HAVE SEEN THERE ARE FEW YOUNG TREES OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0208 GROWING UP AROUND THE FAILING OLD ONES TO PERPETUATE THE RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0209 AND IN AS MUCH AS THOSE AGED SEQUOIAS SO NEARLY CHILDLESS ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0210 THE ONLY ONES COMMONLY KNOWN THE SPECIES TO MOST OBSERVERS SEEMS DOOMED TO SPEEDY EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0211 AS BEING NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXPIRING REMNANT VANQUISHED IN THE SO CALLED STRUGGLE FOR LIFE BY PINES AND FIRS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0212 THAT HAVE DRIVEN IT INTO ITS LAST STRONGHOLDS IN MOIST GLENS WHERE CLIMATE IS EXCEPTIONALLY FAVORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0213 BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE MAJESTIC CONTINUOUS FORESTS OF THE SOUTH CREATES A VERY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0214 NO TREE OF ALL THE FOREST IS MORE ENDURINGLY ESTABLISHED IN CONCORDANCE WITH CLIMATE AND SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0215 IT GROWS HEARTILY EVERYWHERE ON MORAINES ROCKY LEDGES ALONG WATERCOURSES AND IN THE DEEP MOIST ALLUVIUM OF MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0216 WITH A MULTITUDE OF SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS CROWDING UP AROUND THE AGED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0217 SEEMINGLY ABUNDANTLY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE FOREST IN PRIME VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0218 FOR EVERY OLD STORM STRICKEN TREE THERE IS ONE OR MORE IN ALL THE GLORY OF PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0219 AND FOR EACH OF THESE MANY YOUNG TREES AND CROWDS OF EXUBERANT SAPLINGS SO THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0220 IF ALL THE TREES OF ANY SECTION OF THE MAIN SEQUOIA FOREST WERE RANGED TOGETHER ACCORDING TO AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0221 A VERY PROMISING CURVE WOULD BE PRESENTED ALL THE WAY UP FROM LAST YEAR'S SEEDLINGS TO GIANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0222 AND WITH THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED PORTION OF THE CURVE MANY TIMES LONGER THAN THE OLD PORTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0223 EVEN AS FAR NORTH AS THE FRESNO I COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX SAPLINGS AND SEEDLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0224 GROWING PROMISINGLY UPON A PIECE OF ROUGH AVALANCHE SOIL NOT EXCEEDING TWO ACRES IN AREA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0225 THIS SOIL BED IS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN SEEDED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY BY PINES FIRS LIBOCEDRUS AND SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0226 PRESENTING A SIMPLE AND INSTRUCTIVE ILLUSTRATION OF THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE AMONG THE RIVAL SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0227 AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE CONDITIONS THUS FAR AFFECTING THEM HAVE ENABLED THE YOUNG SEQUOIAS TO GAIN A MARKED ADVANTAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0228 IN EVERY INSTANCE LIKE THE ABOVE I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE SEEDLING SEQUOIA IS CAPABLE OF GROWING ON BOTH DRIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0229 AND WETTER SOIL THAN ITS RIVALS BUT REQUIRES MORE SUNSHINE THAN THEY THE LATTER FACT BEING CLEARLY SHOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0230 WHEREVER A SUGAR PINE OR FIR IS GROWING IN CLOSE CONTACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0231 WITH A SEQUOIA OF ABOUT EQUAL AGE AND SIZE AND EQUALLY EXPOSED TO THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0232 THE BRANCHES OF THE LATTER IN SUCH CASES ARE ALWAYS LESS LEAFY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0233 TOWARD THE SOUTH HOWEVER WHERE THE SEQUOIA BECOMES MORE EXUBERANT AND NUMEROUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0234 THE RIVAL TREES BECOME LESS SO AND WHERE THEY MIX WITH SEQUOIAS THEY MOSTLY GROW UP BENEATH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0235 LIKE SLENDER GRASSES AMONG STALKS OF INDIAN CORN UPON A BED OF SANDY FLOOD SOIL I COUNTED NINETY FOUR SEQUOIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0236 FROM ONE TO TWELVE FEET HIGH ON A PATCH OF GROUND ONCE OCCUPIED BY FOUR LARGE SUGAR PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0237 WHICH LAY CRUMBLING BENEATH THEM AN INSTANCE OF CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE ENABLED SEQUOIAS TO CROWD OUT THE PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0238 I ALSO NOTED EIGHTY SIX VIGOROUS SAPLINGS UPON A PIECE OF FRESH GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0239 PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION BY FIRE THUS FIRE THE GREAT DESTROYER OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0240 ALSO FURNISHES BARE VIRGIN GROUND ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS GROWTH FROM THE SEED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0241 FRESH GROUND IS HOWEVER FURNISHED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FOR THE CONSTANT RENEWAL OF THE FORESTS WITHOUT FIRE VIZ BY THE FALL OF OLD TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0242 THE SOIL IS THUS UPTURNED AND MELLOWED AND MANY TREES ARE PLANTED FOR EVERY ONE THAT FALLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0243 LAND SLIPS AND FLOODS ALSO GIVE RISE TO BARE VIRGIN GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0244 AND A TREE NOW AND THEN OWES ITS EXISTENCE TO A BURROWING WOLF OR SQUIRREL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0245 BUT THE MOST REGULAR SUPPLY OF FRESH SOIL IS FURNISHED BY THE FALL OF AGED TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0246 THE CLIMATIC CHANGES IN PROGRESS IN THE SIERRA BEARING ON THE TENURE OF TREE LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0247 ARE ENTIRELY MISAPPREHENDED ESPECIALLY AS TO THE TIME AND THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY NATURE IN EFFECTING THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0248 IT IS CONSTANTLY ASSERTED IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THE SIERRA WAS VASTLY WETTER THAN NOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0249 AND THAT THE INCREASING DROUGHT WILL OF ITSELF EXTINGUISH SEQUOIA LEAVING ITS GROUND TO OTHER TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0250 SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF NOURISHING IN A DRIER CLIMATE BUT THAT SEQUOIA CAN AND DOES GROW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0251 ON AS DRY GROUND AS ANY OF ITS PRESENT RIVALS IS MANIFEST IN A THOUSAND PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0252 WHY THEN IT WILL BE ASKED ARE SEQUOIAS ALWAYS FOUND IN GREATEST ABUNDANCE IN WELL WATERED PLACES WHERE STREAMS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY ABUNDANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0253 SIMPLY BECAUSE A GROWTH OF SEQUOIAS CREATES THOSE STREAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0254 THE THIRSTY MOUNTAINEER KNOWS WELL THAT IN EVERY SEQUOIA GROVE HE WILL FIND RUNNING WATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0255 BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE WATER IS THE CAUSE OF THE GROVE BEING THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0256 ON THE CONTRARY THE GROVE IS THE CAUSE OF THE WATER BEING THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0257 DRAIN OFF THE WATER AND THE TREES WILL REMAIN BUT CUT OFF THE TREES AND THE STREAMS WILL VANISH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0258 NEVER WAS CAUSE MORE COMPLETELY MISTAKEN FOR EFFECT THAN IN THE CASE OF THESE RELATED PHENOMENA OF SEQUOIA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0259 AND PERENNIAL STREAMS AND I CONFESS THAT AT FIRST I SHARED IN THE BLUNDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0260 WHEN ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE METHOD OF SEQUOIA STREAM MAKING IT WILL BE APPREHENDED AT ONCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0261 THE ROOTS OF THIS IMMENSE TREE FILL THE GROUND FORMING A THICK SPONGE THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0262 ABSORBS AND HOLDS BACK THE RAINS AND MELTING SNOWS ONLY ALLOWING THEM TO OOZE AND FLOW GENTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0263 INDEED EVERY FALLEN LEAF AND ROOTLET AS WELL AS LONG CLASPING ROOT AND PROSTRATE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0264 MAY BE REGARDED AS A DAM HOARDING THE BOUNTY OF STORM CLOUDS AND DISPENSING IT AS BLESSINGS ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0265 INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT TO GO HEADLONG IN SHORT LIVED FLOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0266 EVAPORATION IS ALSO CHECKED BY THE DENSE FOLIAGE TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN BY ANY OTHER SIERRA TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0267 AND THE AIR IS ENTANGLED IN MASSES AND BROAD SHEETS THAT ARE QUICKLY SATURATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0268 WHILE THIRSTY WINDS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO SPONGING AND LICKING ALONG THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0269 SO GREAT IS THE RETENTION OF WATER IN MANY PLACES IN THE MAIN BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0270 THAT BOGS AND MEADOWS ARE CREATED BY THE KILLING OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0271 A SINGLE TRUNK FALLING ACROSS A STREAM IN THE WOODS FORMS A DAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0272 TWO HUNDRED FEET LONG AND FROM TEN TO THIRTY FEET HIGH GIVING RISE TO A POND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0273 WHICH KILLS THE TREES WITHIN ITS REACH THESE DEAD TREES FALL IN TURN THUS MAKING A CLEARING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0274 WHILE SEDIMENTS GRADUALLY ACCUMULATE CHANGING THE POND INTO A BOG OR MEADOW FOR A
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0275 GROWTH OF CARICES AND SPHAGNUM IN SOME INSTANCES A SERIES OF SMALL BOGS OR MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0276 RISE ABOVE ONE ANOTHER ON A HILLSIDE WHICH ARE GRADUALLY MERGED INTO ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0277 FORMING SLOPING BOGS OR MEADOWS WHICH MAKE STRIKING FEATURES OF SEQUOIA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0278 AND SINCE ALL THE TREES THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO THEM HAVE BEEN PRESERVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0279 THEY CONTAIN RECORDS OF THE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THEY BEGAN TO FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0280 SINCE THEN IT IS A FACT THAT THOUSANDS OF SEQUOIAS ARE GROWING THRIFTILY ON WHAT IS TERMED DRY GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0281 AND EVEN CLINGING LIKE MOUNTAIN PINES TO RIFTS IN GRANITE PRECIPICES AND SINCE IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0282 THAT THE EXTRA MOISTURE FOUND IN CONNECTION WITH THE DENSER GROWTHS IS AN EFFECT OF THEIR PRESENCE INSTEAD OF A CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0283 THEN THE NOTIONS AS TO THE FORMER EXTENSION OF THE SPECIES AND ITS NEAR APPROACH TO EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0284 BASED UPON ITS SUPPOSED DEPENDENCE ON GREATER MOISTURE ARE SEEN TO BE ERRONEOUS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0285 DECREASE IN THE RAIN AND SNOW FALL SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD IN THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0286 IS MUCH LESS THAN IS COMMONLY GUESSED THE HIGHEST POST GLACIAL WATERMARKS ARE WELL PRESERVED IN ALL THE UPPER RIVER CHANNELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0287 AND THEY ARE NOT GREATLY HIGHER THAN THE SPRING FLOODMARKS OF THE PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0288 SHOWING CONCLUSIVELY THAT NO EXTRAORDINARY DECREASE HAS TAKEN PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0289 IN THE VOLUME OF THE UPPER TRIBUTARIES OF POST GLACIAL SIERRA STREAMS SINCE THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0290 BUT IN THE MEAN TIME ELIMINATING ALL THIS COMPLICATED QUESTION OF CLIMATIC CHANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0291 THE PLAIN FACT REMAINS THAT THE PRESENT RAIN AND SNOW FALL IS ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0292 THE LUXURIANT GROWTH OF SEQUOIA FORESTS INDEED ALL MY OBSERVATIONS TEND TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0293 THAT IN A PROLONGED DROUGHT THE SUGAR PINES AND FIRS WOULD PERISH BEFORE THE SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0294 NOT ALONE BECAUSE OF THE GREATER LONGEVITY OF INDIVIDUAL TREES BUT BECAUSE THE SPECIES CAN ENDURE MORE DROUGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0295 AND MAKE THE MOST OF WHATEVER MOISTURE FALLS AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0296 IF THE RESTRICTION AND IRREGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES BE INTERPRETED AS A RESULT OF THE DESICCATION OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0297 THEN INSTEAD OF INCREASING AS IT DOES IN INDIVIDUALS TOWARD THE SOUTH WHERE THE RAINFALL IS LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0298 IT SHOULD DIMINISH IF THEN THE PECULIAR DISTRIBUTION OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0299 HAS NOT BEEN GOVERNED BY SUPERIOR CONDITIONS OF SOIL AS TO FERTILITY OR MOISTURE BY WHAT HAS IT BEEN GOVERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0300 IN THE COURSE OF MY STUDIES I OBSERVED THAT THE NORTHERN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0301 THE ONLY ONES I WAS AT FIRST ACQUAINTED WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0302 WERE LOCATED ON JUST THOSE PORTIONS OF THE GENERAL FOREST SOIL BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0303 THAT WERE FIRST LAID BARE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0304 WHEN THE ICE SHEET BEGAN TO BREAK UP INTO INDIVIDUAL GLACIERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0305 AND WHILE SEARCHING THE WIDE BASIN OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0306 TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ABSENCE OF SEQUOIA WHERE EVERY CONDITION SEEMED FAVORABLE FOR ITS GROWTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0307 IT OCCURED TO ME THAT THIS REMARKABLE GAP IN THE SEQUOIA BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0308 IS LOCATED EXACTLY IN THE BASIN OF THE VAST ANCIENT MER DE GLACE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0309 AND KING'S RIVER BASINS WHICH POURED ITS FROZEN FLOODS TO THE PLAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0310 FED BY THE SNOWS THAT FELL ON MORE THAN FIFTY MILES OF THE SUMMIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0311 I THEN PERCEIVED THAT THE NEXT GREAT GAP IN THE BELT TO THE NORTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0312 FORTY MILES WIDE EXTENDING BETWEEN THE CALAVERAS AND TUOLUMNE GROVES OCCURS IN THE BASIN OF THE GREAT ANCIENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0313 MER DE GLACE OF THE TUOLUMNE AND STANISLAUS BASINS AND THAT THE SMALLER GAP BETWEEN THE MERCED AND MARIPOSA GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0314 OCCURS IN THE BASIN OF THE SMALLER GLACIER OF THE MERCED THE WIDER THE ANCIENT GLACIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0315 THE WIDER THE CORRESPONDING GAP IN THE SEQUOIA BELT FINALLY PURSUING MY INVESTIGATIONS ACROSS THE BASINS OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0316 I DISCOVERED THAT THE SEQUOIA BELT ATTAINED ITS GREATEST DEVELOPMENT JUST WHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0317 OWING TO THE TOPOGRAPHICAL PECULIARITIES OF THE REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0318 THE GROUND HAD BEEN MOST PERFECTLY PROTECTED FROM THE MAIN ICE RIVERS THAT CONTINUED TO POUR PAST FROM THE SUMMIT FOUNTAINS LONG AFTER THE SMALLER LOCAL GLACIERS HAD BEEN MELTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0319 TAKING NOW A GENERAL VIEW OF THE BELT BEGINNING AT THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0320 WE SEE THAT THE MAJESTIC ANCIENT GLACIERS WERE SHED OFF RIGHT AND LEFT DOWN THE VALLEYS OF KERN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0321 AND KING'S RIVERS BY THE LOFTY PROTECTIVE SPURS OUTSPREAD EMBRACINGLY ABOVE THE WARM SEQUOIA FILLED BASINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0322 OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE THEN NEXT NORTHWARD OCCURS THE WIDE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OR BASIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0323 OF THE ANCIENT SAN JOAQUIN AND KING'S RIVER MER DE GLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0324 THEN THE WARM PROTECTED SPOTS OF FRESNO AND MARIPOSA GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0325 THEN THE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OF THE ANCIENT MERCED GLACIER NEXT THE WARM SHELTERED GROUND OF THE MERCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0326 AND TUOLUMNE GROVES THEN THE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OF THE GRAND ANCIENT MER DE GLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0327 OF THE TUOLUMNE AND STANISLAUS THEN THE WARM OLD GROUND OF THE CALAVERAS AND STANISLAUS GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0328 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT JUST WHERE AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0329 THE GLACIERS WERE NOT THERE THE SEQUOIA IS AND JUST WHERE THE GLACIERS WERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0330 THERE THE SEQUOIA IS NOT WHAT THE OTHER CONDITIONS MAY HAVE BEEN THAT ENABLED SEQUOIA TO ESTABLISH ITSELF UPON THESE OLDEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0331 AND WARMEST PORTIONS OF THE MAIN GLACIAL SOIL BELT I CANNOT SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0332 I MIGHT VENTURE TO STATE HOWEVER IN THIS CONNECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0333 THAT SINCE THE SEQUOIA FORESTS PRESENT A MORE AND MORE ANCIENT ASPECT AS THEY EXTEND SOUTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0334 I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE SPECIES WAS DISTRIBUTED FROM THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0335 WHILE THE SUGAR PINE ITS GREAT RIVAL IN THE NORTHERN GROVES SEEMS TO HAVE COME AROUND THE HEAD OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0336 AND DOWN THE SIERRA FROM THE NORTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0337 CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THE SIERRA SOIL BEDS WERE FIRST THROWN OPEN TO PREEMPTION ON THE MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0338 THE SEQUOIA MAY HAVE ESTABLISHED ITSELF ALONG THE AVAILABLE PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH HALF OF THE RANGE PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0339 WHILE THE SUGAR PINE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE NORTH HALF PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0340 BUT HOWEVER MUCH UNCERTAINTY MAY ATTACH TO THIS BRANCH OF THE QUESTION THERE ARE NO OBSCURING SHADOWS UPON THE GRAND GENERAL RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE POINTED OUT BETWEEN THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF SEQUOIA AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0341 THE ANCIENT GLACIERS OF THE SIERRA AND WHEN WE BEAR IN MIND THAT ALL THE PRESENT FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0342 GROWING ON MORAINE SOIL RECENTLY DEPOSITED AND THAT THE FLANK OF THE RANGE ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0343 WITH ALL ITS LANDSCAPES IS NEW BORN RECENTLY SCULPTURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0344 AND BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT OF DAY FROM BENEATH THE ICE MANTLE OF THE GLACIAL WINTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0345 THEN A THOUSAND LAWLESS MYSTERIES DISAPPEAR AND BROAD HARMONIES TAKE THEIR PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0346 BUT ALTHOUGH ALL THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA BEARING ON THE POST GLACIAL HISTORY OF THIS COLOSSAL TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0347 POINT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT NEVER WAS MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0348 ON THE SIERRA SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL EPOCH THAT ITS PRESENT FORESTS ARE SCARCELY PAST PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0349 IF INDEED THEY HAVE REACHED PRIME THAT THE POST GLACIAL DAY OF THE SPECIES IS PROBABLY NOT HALF DONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0350 YET WHEN FROM A WIDER OUTLOOK THE VAST ANTIQUITY OF THE GENUS IS CONSIDERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0351 AND ITS ANCIENT RICHNESS IN SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS COMPARING OUR SIERRA GIANT AND SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0352 OF THE COAST RANGE THE ONLY OTHER LIVING SPECIES OF SEQUOIA WITH THE TWELVE FOSSIL SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0353 ALREADY DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED BY HEER AND LESQUEREUX SOME OF WHICH SEEM TO HAVE FLOURISHED OVER VAST AREAS IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0354 THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND IN EUROPE AND OUR OWN TERRITORIES DURING TERTIARY AND CRETACEOUS TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0355 THEN INDEED IT BECOMES PLAIN THAT OUR TWO SURVIVING SPECIES RESTRICTED TO NARROW BELTS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF CALIFORNIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0356 ARE MERE REMNANTS OF THE GENUS BOTH AS TO SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0357 AND THAT THEY PROBABLY ARE VERGING TO EXTINCTION BUT THE VERGE OF A PERIOD BEGINNING IN CRETACEOUS TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0358 MAY HAVE A BREADTH OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS NOT TO MENTION THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF CONDITIONS CALCULATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0359 TO MULTIPLY AND REEXTEND BOTH SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS THIS HOWEVER IS A BRANCH OF THE QUESTION INTO WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0360 I DO NOT NOW PURPOSE TO ENTER IN STUDYING THE FATE OF OUR FOREST KING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0361 WE HAVE THUS FAR CONSIDERED THE ACTION OF PURELY NATURAL CAUSES ONLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0362 MAN IS IN THE WOODS AND WASTE AND PURE DESTRUCTION ARE MAKING RAPID HEADWAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0363 IF THE IMPORTANCE OF FORESTS WERE AT ALL UNDERSTOOD EVEN FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0364 THEIR PRESERVATION WOULD CALL FORTH THE MOST WATCHFUL ATTENTION OF GOVERNMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0365 ONLY OF LATE YEARS BY MEANS OF FOREST RESERVATIONS HAS THE SIMPLEST GROUNDWORK FOR AVAILABLE LEGISLATION BEEN LAID
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0366 WHILE IN MANY OF THE FINEST GROVES EVERY SPECIES OF DESTRUCTION IS STILL MOVING ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0367 WITH ACCELERATED SPEED IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND NO FEWER THAN FIVE MILLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0368 LOCATED ON OR NEAR THE LOWER EDGE OF THE SEQUOIA BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0369 ALL OF WHICH WERE CUTTING CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF BIG TREE LUMBER MOST OF THE FRESNO GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0370 ARE DOOMED TO FEED THE MILLS RECENTLY ERECTED NEAR THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0371 AND A COMPANY OF LUMBERMEN ARE NOW CUTTING THE MAGNIFICENT FOREST ON KING'S RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0372 IN THESE MILLING OPERATIONS WASTE FAR EXCEEDS USE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0373 FOR AFTER THE CHOICE YOUNG MANAGEABLE TREES ON ANY GIVEN SPOT HAVE BEEN FELLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0374 THE WOODS ARE FIRED TO CLEAR THE GROUND OF LIMBS AND REFUSE WITH REFERENCE TO FURTHER OPERATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0375 AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS ARE DESTROYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0376 THESE MILL RAVAGES HOWEVER ARE SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY SHEEPMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0377 INCREDIBLE NUMBERS OF SHEEP ARE DRIVEN TO THE MOUNTAIN PASTURES EVERY SUMMER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0378 THEIR COURSE IS EVER MARKED BY DESOLATION EVERY WILD GARDEN IS TRODDEN DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0379 THE SHRUBS ARE STRIPPED OF LEAVES AS IF DEVOURED BY LOCUSTS AND THE WOODS ARE BURNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0380 RUNNING FIRES ARE SET EVERYWHERE WITH A VIEW TO CLEARING THE GROUND OF PROSTRATE TRUNKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0381 TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FLOCKS AND IMPROVE THE PASTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0382 THE ENTIRE FOREST BELT IS THUS SWEPT AND DEVASTATED FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0383 AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RESINOUS PINUS CONTORTA SEQUOIA SUFFERS MOST OF ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0384 INDIANS BURN OFF THE UNDERBRUSH IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES TO FACILITATE DEER HUNTING MOUNTAINEERS AND LUMBERMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0385 CARELESSLY ALLOW THEIR CAMP FIRES TO RUN BUT THE FIRES OF THE SHEEPMEN OR MUTTONEERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0386 FORM MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF ALL DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THAT RANGE THE SIERRA FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0387 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUR FOREST KING MIGHT LIVE ON GLORIOUSLY IN NATURE'S KEEPING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0388 IT IS RAPIDLY VANISHING BEFORE THE FIRE AND STEEL OF MAN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0389 UNLESS PROTECTIVE MEASURES BE SPEEDILY INVENTED AND APPLIED IN A FEW DECADES AT THE FARTHEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0390 ALL THAT WILL BE LEFT OF SEQUOIA GIGANTEA WILL BE A FEW HACKED AND SCARRED MONUMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2/wav/mtn0391 END OF CHAPTER EIGHT PART TWO
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
koopero-20090127-flx/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
koopero-20091113-qke/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
kpeysin-20090212-syj/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
Krellis-20090608-fyo/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
Krellis-20090608-jue/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
Krellis-20090608-kpj/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
Krellis-20090608-sjw/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
Krellis-20090608-wuu/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
Krellis-20090609-ave/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
Krellis-20090609-nha/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK

Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
Krellis-20090609-wfz/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
Krishna-20090503-mny/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
Kristina-20100117-tgp/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
kurianthayil-20090102-sji/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
Kyton-20081201-bay/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Kyton-20081201-gzs/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
Kyton-20081201-isv/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
Kyton-20081201-jmv/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
Kyton-20081201-sge/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
Kyton-20081201-srl/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
Kyton-20081201-tvr/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Kyton-20081201-uan/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
Kyton-20081201-vtl/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND

L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-fhz/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-hij/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES

L1ttl3J1m-20090701-yfs/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-yfs/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
L1ttl3J1m-20090701-yfs/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
lance_-20080402-nhk/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL

lance_-20080402-nhk/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
lance_-20080402-nhk/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
lance_-20080402-nhk/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER

laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
laserbeams-20081202-dcx/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
laserbeams-20081202-hgu/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS

laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
laserbeams-20081202-knp/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
laserbeams-20081202-lvo/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT

laserbeams-20081202-lvo/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
laserbeams-20081202-lvo/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
laserbeams-20081202-lvo/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
laserbeams-20081202-lvo/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
laserbeams-20081202-sun/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA

leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0003 LEVIATHAN BY THOMAS HOBBES CHAPTER TWENTY TWO OF SYSTEMS SUBJECT POLITICAL AND PRIVATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0004 HAVING SPOKEN OF THE GENERATION FORM AND POWER OF A COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0005 I AM IN ORDER TO SPEAK NEXT OF THE PARTS THEREOF AND FIRST OF SYSTEMS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0006 WHICH RESEMBLE THE SIMILAR PARTS OR MUSCLES OF A BODY NATURAL BY SYSTEMS I UNDERSTAND ANY NUMBERS OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0007 JOINED IN ONE INTEREST OR ONE BUSINESS OF WHICH SOME ARE REGULAR AND SOME IRREGULAR
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0008 REGULAR ARE THOSE WHERE ONE MAN OR ASSEMBLY OF MEN IS CONSTITUTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WHOLE NUMBER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0009 ALL OTHER ARE IRREGULAR OF REGULAR SOME ARE ABSOLUTE AND INDEPENDENT SUBJECT TO NONE BUT THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0010 SUCH ARE ONLY COMMON WEALTHS OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN ALREADY IN THE FIVE LAST PRECEDING CHAPTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0011 OTHERS ARE DEPENDENT THAT IS TO SAY SUBORDINATE TO SOME SOVEREIGN POWER TO WHICH EVERY ONE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0012 AS ALSO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS SUBJECT OF SYSTEMS SUBORDINATE SOME ARE POLITICAL AND SOME PRIVATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0013 POLITICAL OTHERWISE CALLED BODIES POLITIC AND PERSONS IN LAW
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0014 ARE THOSE WHICH ARE MADE BY AUTHORITY FROM THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0015 PRIVATE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE CONSTITUTED BY SUBJECTS AMONGST THEMSELVES OR BY AUTHORITY FROM A STRANGER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0016 FOR NO AUTHORITY DERIVED FROM FOREIGN POWER WITHIN THE DOMINION OF ANOTHER IS PUBLIC THERE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0017 BUT PRIVATE AND OF PRIVATE SYSTEMS SOME ARE LAWFUL SOME UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0018 LAWFUL ARE THOSE WHICH ARE ALLOWED BY THE COMMON WEALTH ALL OTHER ARE UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0019 IRREGULAR SYSTEMS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVING NO REPRESENTATIVE CONSIST ONLY IN CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0020 WHICH IF NOT FORBIDDEN BY THE COMMON WEALTH NOR MADE ON EVIL DESIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0021 SUCH AS ARE CONFLUX OF PEOPLE TO MARKETS OR SHOWS OR ANY OTHER HARMLESS END
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0022 ARE LAWFUL BUT WHEN THE INTENTION IS EVIL OR IF THE NUMBER BE CONSIDERABLE UNKNOWN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0023 THEY ARE UNLAWFUL IN BODIES POLITIC THE POWER OF THE REPRESENTATIVE IS ALWAYS LIMITED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0024 AND THAT WHICH PRESCRIBETH THE LIMITS THEREOF IS THE POWER SOVEREIGN FOR POWER UNLIMITED IS ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY AND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0025 THE SOVEREIGN IN EVERY COMMONWEALTH IS THE ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0026 AND THEREFORE NO OTHER CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PART OF THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0027 BUT SO FAR FORTH AS HE SHALL GIVE LEAVE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0028 AND TO GIVE LEAVE TO A BODY POLITIC OF SUBJECTS TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0029 TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WERE TO ABANDON THE GOVERNMENT OF SO MUCH OF THE COMMONWEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0030 AND TO DIVIDE THE DOMINION CONTRARY TO THEIR PEACE AND DEFENSE WHICH THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO DOE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0031 BY ANY GRANT THAT DOES NOT PLAINLY AND DIRECTLY DISCHARGE THEM OF THEIR SUBJECTION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0032 FOR CONSEQUENCES OF WORDS ARE NOT THE SIGNS OF HIS WILL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0033 WHEN OTHER CONSEQUENCES ARE SIGNS OF THE CONTRARY BUT RATHER SIGNS OF ERROR AND MISRECKONING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0034 TO WHICH ALL MANKIND IS TOO PRONE THE BOUNDS OF THAT POWER WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0035 ARE TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF FROM TWO THINGS ONE IS THEIR WRIT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0036 OR LETTERS FROM THE SOVEREIGN THE OTHER IS THE LAW OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0037 FOR THOUGH IN THE INSTITUTION OR ACQUISITION OF A COMMON WEALTH WHICH IS INDEPENDENT THERE NEEDS NO WRITING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0038 BECAUSE THE POWER OF THE REPRESENTATIVE HAS THERE NO OTHER BOUNDS BUT SUCH AS ARE SET OUT BY THE UNWRITTEN LAW OF NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0039 YET IN SUBORDINATE BODIES THERE ARE SUCH DIVERSITIES OF LIMITATION NECESSARY CONCERNING THEIR BUSINESS TIMES AND PLACES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0040 AS CAN NEITHER BE REMEMBERED WITHOUT LETTERS NOR TAKEN NOTICE OF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0041 UNLESS SUCH LETTERS BE PATENT THAT THEY MAY BE READ TO THEM AND WITHALL SEALED OR TESTIFIED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0042 WITH THE SEALS OR OTHER PERMANENT SIGNS OF THE AUTHORITY SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0043 AND BECAUSE SUCH LIMITATION IS NOT ALWAYS EASY OR PERHAPS POSSIBLE TO BE DESCRIBED IN WRITING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0044 THE ORDINARY LAWS COMMON TO ALL SUBJECTS MUST DETERMINE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE MAY LAWFULLY DO
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0045 IN ALL CASES WHERE THE LETTERS THEMSELVES ARE SILENT AND THEREFORE IN A BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0046 IF THE REPRESENTATIVE BE ONE MAN WHATSOEVER HE DOES IN THE PERSON OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0047 WHICH IS NOT WARRANTED IN HIS LETTERS NOR BY THE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0048 IS HIS OWN ACT AND NOT THE ACT OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0049 NOR OF ANY OTHER MEMBER THEREOF BESIDES HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0050 BECAUSE FURTHER THAN HIS LETTERS OR THE LAWS LIMIT HE REPRESENTETH NO MANS PERSON BUT HIS OWN BUT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0051 WHAT HE DOES ACCORDING TO THESE IS THE ACT OF EVERY ONE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0052 FOR OF THE ACT OF THE SOVEREIGN EVERY ONE IS AUTHOR BECAUSE HE IS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE UNLIMITED AND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0053 THE ACT OF HIM THAT RECEDES NOT FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0054 IS THE ACT OF THE SOVEREIGN AND THEREFORE EVERY MEMBER OF THE BODY IS AUTHOR OF IT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0055 BUT IF THE REPRESENTATIVE BE AN ASSEMBLY WHATSOEVER THAT ASSEMBLY SHALL DECREE NOT WARRANTED BY THEIR LETTERS OR THE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0056 IS THE ACT OF THE ASSEMBLY OR BODY POLITIC AND THE ACT OF EVERY ONE BY WHOSE VOTE THE DECREE WAS MADE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0057 BUT NOT THE ACT OF ANY MAN THAT BEING PRESENT VOTED TO THE CONTRARY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0058 NOR OF ANY MAN ABSENT UNLESS HE VOTED IT BY PROCURATION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0059 IT IS THE ACT OF THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE VOTED BY THE MAJOR PART
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0060 AND IF IT BE A CRIME THE ASSEMBLY MAY BE PUNISHED AS FAR FORTH AS IT IS CAPABLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0061 AS BY DISSOLUTION OR FORFEITURE OF THEIR LETTERS WHICH IS TO SUCH ARTIFICIAL AND FICTITIOUS BODIES CAPITAL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0062 OR IF THE ASSEMBLY HAVE A COMMON STOCK WHEREIN NONE OF THE INNOCENT MEMBERS HAVE PROPRIETY BY PECUNIARY MULCT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0063 FOR FROM CORPORAL PENALTIES NATURE HATH EXEMPTED ALL BODIES POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0064 BUT THEY THAT GAVE NOT THEIR VOTE ARE THEREFORE INNOCENT BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLY CANNOT REPRESENT ANY MAN IN THINGS UNWARRANTED BY THEIR LETTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0065 AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THEIR VOTES IF THE PERSON OF THE BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0066 BEING IN ONE MAN BORROW MONEY OF A STRANGER THAT IS OF ONE THAT IS NOT OF THE SAME BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0067 FOR NO LETTERS NEED LIMIT BORROWING SEEING IT IS LEFT TO MENS OWN INCLINATIONS TO LIMIT LENDING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0068 THE DEBT IS THE REPRESENTATIVES FOR IF HE SHOULD HAVE AUTHORITY FROM HIS LETTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0069 TO MAKE THE MEMBERS PAY WHAT HE BORROWETH HE SHOULD HAVE BY CONSEQUENCE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0070 AND THEREFORE THE GRANT WERE EITHER VOYD AS PROCEEDING FROM ERROR COMMONLY INCIDENT TO HUMANE NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0071 AND AN INSUFFICIENT SIGN OF THE WILL OF THE GRANTER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0072 OR IF IT BE AVOWED BY HIM THEN IS THE REPRESENTER SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0073 AND FALLETH NOT UNDER THE PRESENT QUESTION WHICH IS ONLY OF BODIES SUBORDINATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0074 NO MEMBER THEREFORE IS OBLIGED TO PAY THE DEBT SO BORROWED BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0075 BECAUSE HE THAT LENDETH IT BEING A STRANGER TO THE LETTERS AND TO THE QUALIFICATION OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0076 UNDERSTANDETH THOSE ONLY FOR HIS DEBTORS THAT ARE ENGAGED AND SEEING THE REPRESENTER CAN ENGAGE HIMSELF AND NONE ELSE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0077 HAS HIM ONLY FOR DEBTOR WHO MUST THEREFORE PAY HIM OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK IF THERE BE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0078 OR IF THERE BE NONE OUT OF HIS OWN ESTATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0079 IF HE COME INTO DEBT BY CONTRACT OR MULCT THE CASE IS THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0080 BUT WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE IS AN ASSEMBLY AND THE DEBT TO A STRANGER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0081 ALL THEY AND ONLY THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEBT THAT GAVE THEIR VOTES TO THE BORROWING OF IT OR TO THE CONTRACT THAT MADE IT DUE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0082 OR TO THE FACT FOR WHICH THE MULCT WAS IMPOSED BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF THOSE IN VOTING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0083 DID ENGAGE HIMSELF FOR THE PAYMENT FOR HE THAT IS AUTHOR OF THE BORROWING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0084 IS OBLIGED TO THE PAYMENT EVEN OF THE WHOLE DEBT THOUGH WHEN PAID BY ANY ONE HE BE DISCHARGED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0085 BUT IF THE DEBT BE TO ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY THE ASSEMBLY ONLY IS OBLIGED TO THE PAYMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0086 OUT OF THEIR COMMON STOCK IF THEY HAVE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0087 FOR HAVING LIBERTY OF VOTE IF HE VOTE THE MONEY SHALL BE BORROWED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0088 HE VOTES IT SHALL BE PAID IF HE VOTE IT SHALL NOT BE BORROWED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0089 OR BE ABSENT YET BECAUSE IN LENDING HE VOTETH THE BORROWING HE CONTRADICTETH HIS FORMER VOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0090 AND IS OBLIGED BY THE LATER AND BECOMES BOTH BORROWER AND LENDER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0091 AND CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT DEMAND PAYMENT FROM ANY PARTICULAR MAN BUT FROM THE COMMON TREASURE ONLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0092 WHICH FAILING HE HATH NO REMEDY NOR COMPLAINT BUT AGAINST HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0093 THAT BEING PRIVY TO THE ACTS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THEIR MEANS TO PAY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0094 AND NOT BEING ENFORCED DID NEVERTHELESS THROUGH HIS OWN FOLLY LEND HIS MONEY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0095 IT IS MANIFEST BY THIS THAT IN BODIES POLITIC SUBORDINATE AND SUBJECT TO A SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0096 IT IS SOMETIMES NOT ONLY LAWFUL BUT EXPEDIENT FOR A PARTICULAR MAN TO MAKE OPEN PROTESTATION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0097 AGAINST THE DECREES OF THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY AND CAUSE THEIR DISSENT TO BE REGISTERED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0098 OR TO TAKE WITNESS OF IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY MAY BE OBLIGED TO PAY DEBTS CONTRACTED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0099 AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES COMMITTED BY OTHER MEN BUT IN A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY THAT LIBERTY IS TAKEN AWAY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0100 BOTH BECAUSE HE THAT PROTESTETH THERE DENIES THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND ALSO BECAUSE WHATSOEVER IS COMMANDED BY THE SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0101 IS AS TO THE SUBJECT THOUGH NOT SO ALWAYS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0102 JUSTIFIED BY THE COMMAND FOR OF SUCH COMMAND EVERY SUBJECT IS THE AUTHOR
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0103 THE VARIETY OF BODIES POLITIC IS ALMOST INFINITE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0104 FOR THEY ARE NOT ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE SEVERAL AFFAIRS FOR WHICH THEY ARE CONSTITUTED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0105 WHEREIN THERE IS AN UNSPEAKABLE DIVERSITY BUT ALSO BY THE TIMES PLACES AND NUMBERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0106 SUBJECT TO MANY LIMITATIONS AND AS TO THEIR AFFAIRS SOME ARE ORDAINED FOR GOVERNMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0107 AS FIRST THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE MAY BE COMMITTED TO AN ASSEMBLY OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0108 WHEREIN ALL RESOLUTIONS SHALL DEPEND ON THE VOTES OF THE MAJOR PART
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0109 AND THEN THIS ASSEMBLY IS A BODY POLITIC AND THEIR POWER LIMITED BY COMMISSION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0110 THIS WORD PROVINCE SIGNIFIES A CHARGE OR CARE OF BUSINESS WHICH HE WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0111 COMMITTETH TO ANOTHER MAN TO BE ADMINISTERED FOR AND UNDER HIM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0112 AND THEREFORE WHEN IN ONE COMMON WEALTH THERE BE DIVERS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THEIR LAWS DISTINCT ONE FROM ANOTHER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0113 OR ARE FAR DISTANT IN PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT BEING COMMITTED TO DIVERS PERSONS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0114 THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THE SOVEREIGN IS NOT RESIDENT BUT GOVERNS BY COMMISSION ARE CALLED PROVINCES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0115 BUT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE BY AN ASSEMBLY RESIDING IN THE PROVINCE IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0116 THERE BE FEW EXAMPLES THE ROMANS WHO HAD THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MANY PROVINCES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0117 YET GOVERNED THEM ALWAYS BY PRESIDENTS AND PRAETORS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0118 AND NOT BY ASSEMBLIES AS THEY GOVERNED THE CITY OF ROME AND TERRITORIES ADJACENT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0119 IN LIKE MANNER WHEN THERE WERE COLONIES SENT FROM ENGLAND TO PLANT VIRGINIA AND SOMMER ISLANDS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0120 THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF THEM HERE WERE COMMITTED TO ASSEMBLIES IN LONDON
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0121 YET DID THOSE ASSEMBLIES NEVER COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THEM TO ANY ASSEMBLY THERE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0122 BUT DID TO EACH PLANTATION SEND ONE GOVERNOR FOR THOUGH EVERY MAN WHERE HE CAN BE PRESENT BY NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0123 DESIRES TO PARTICIPATE OF GOVERNMENT YET WHERE THEY CANNOT BE PRESENT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0124 THEY ARE BY NATURE ALSO INCLINED TO COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR COMMON INTEREST RATHER TO A MONARCHICAL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0125 THEN A POPULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THOSE MEN THAT HAVE GREAT PRIVATE ESTATES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0126 WHO WHEN THEY ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE THE PAINS OF ADMINISTERING THE BUSINESS THAT BELONGS TO THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0127 CHOOSE RATHER TO TRUST ONE SERVANT THAN A ASSEMBLY EITHER OF THEIR FRIENDS OR SERVANTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0128 BUT HOWSOEVER IT BE IN FACT YET WE MAY SUPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE OR COLONY COMMITTED TO AN ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0129 AND WHEN IT IS THAT WHICH IN THIS PLACE I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0130 THAT WHATSOEVER DEBT IS BY THAT ASSEMBLY CONTRACTED OR WHATSOEVER UNLAWFUL ACT IS DECREED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0131 IS THE ACT ONLY OF THOSE THAT ASSENTED AND NOT OF ANY THAT DISSENTED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0132 OR WERE ABSENT FOR THE REASONS BEFORE ALLEGED ALSO THAT AN ASSEMBLY RESIDING OUT OF THE BOUNDS OF THAT COLONY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0133 WHEREOF THEY HAVE THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT EXECUTE ANY POWER OVER THE PERSONS OR GOODS OF ANY OF THE COLONY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0134 TO SEIZE ON THEM FOR DEBT OR OTHER DUTY IN ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE COLONY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0135 AS HAVING NO JURISDICTION NOR AUTHORITY ELSEWHERE BUT ARE LEFT TO THE REMEDY WHICH THE LAW OF THE PLACE ALLOWETH THEM AND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0136 THOUGH THE ASSEMBLY HAVE RIGHT TO IMPOSE A MULCT UPON ANY OF THEIR MEMBERS THAT SHALL BREAK THE LAWS THEY MAKE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0137 YET OUT OF THE COLONY IT SELF THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXECUTE THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0138 AND THAT WHICH IS SAID HERE OF THE RIGHTS OF AN ASSEMBLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0139 OR A COLONY IS APPLICABLE ALSO TO AN ASSEMBLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A TOWN OR
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0140 UNIVERSITY OR A COLLEGE OR A CHURCH OR FOR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT OVER THE PERSONS OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0141 AND GENERALLY IN ALL BODIES POLITIC IF ANY PARTICULAR MEMBER CONCEIVE HIMSELF INJURED BY THE BODY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0142 THE COGNISANCE OF HIS CAUSE BELONGED TO THE SOVEREIGN AND THOSE THE SOVEREIGN HATH ORDAINED FOR JUDGES IN SUCH CAUSES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0143 OR SHALL ORDAIN FOR THAT PARTICULAR CAUSE AND NOT TO THE BODY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0144 FOR THE WHOLE BODY IS IN THIS CASE HIS FELLOW SUBJECT WHICH IN A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY IS OTHERWISE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0145 FOR THERE IF THE SOVEREIGN BE NOT JUDGE THOUGH IN HIS OWN CAUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0146 THERE CAN BE NO JUDGE AT ALL IN A BODY POLITIC FOR THE WELL ORDERING OF FOREIGN TRAFFIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0147 THE MOST COMMODIOUS REPRESENTATIVE IS AN ASSEMBLY OF ALL THE MEMBERS THAT IS TO SAY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0148 SUCH A ONE AS EVERY ONE THAT ADVENTURETH HIS MONEY MAY BE PRESENT AT ALL THE DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0149 IF THEY WILL THEMSELVES FOR PROOF WHEREOF WE ARE TO CONSIDER THE END FOR WHICH MEN THAT ARE MERCHANTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0150 AND MAY BUY AND SELL EXPORT AND IMPORT THEIR MERCHANDISE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN DISCRETIONS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0151 DOE NEVERTHELESS BIND THEMSELVES UP IN ONE CORPORATION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0152 IT IS TRUE THERE BE FEW MERCHANTS THAT WITH THE MERCHANDISE THEY BUY AT HOME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0153 CAN FREIGHT A SHIP TO EXPORT IT OR WITH THAT THEY BUY ABROAD TO BRING IT HOME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0154 AND HAVE THEREFORE NEED TO JOIN TOGETHER IN ONE SOCIETY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY EITHER PARTICIPATE OF THE GAIN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0155 ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF HIS ADVENTURE OR TAKE HIS OWN AND SELL WHAT HE TRANSPORTS OR IMPORTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0156 AT SUCH PRICES AS HE THINKS FIT BUT THIS IS NO BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0157 THERE BEING NO COMMON REPRESENTATIVE TO OBLIGE THEM TO ANY OTHER LAW THAN THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL OTHER SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0158 THE END OF THEIR INCORPORATING IS TO MAKE THEIR GAIN THE GREATER WHICH IS DONE TWO WAYS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0159 BY SOLE BUYING AND SOLE SELLING BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0160 SO THAT TO GRANT TO A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS TO BE A CORPORATION OR BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0161 IS TO GRANT THEM A DOUBLE MONOPOLY WHEREOF ONE IS TO BE SOLE BUYERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0162 ANOTHER TO BE SOLE SELLERS FOR WHEN THERE IS A COMPANY INCORPORATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0163 THEY ONLY EXPORT THE COMMODITIES VENDIBLE IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH IS SOLE BUYING AT HOME AND SOLE SELLING ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0164 FOR AT HOME THERE IS BUT ONE BUYER AND ABROAD BUT ONE THAT SELLETH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0165 BOTH WHICH IS GAINFUL TO THE MERCHANT BECAUSE THEREBY THEY BUY AT HOME AT LOWER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0166 AND SELL ABROAD AT HIGHER RATES AND ABROAD THERE IS BUT ONE BUYER OF FOREIGN MERCHANDISE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0167 AND BUT ONE THAT SELLS THEM AT HOME BOTH WHICH AGAIN ARE GAINFUL TO THE ADVENTURERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0168 OF THIS DOUBLE MONOPOLY ONE PART IS DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME THE OTHER TO FOREIGNERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0169 FOR AT HOME BY THEIR SOLE EXPORTATION THEY SET WHAT PRICE THEY PLEASE ON THE HUSBANDRY AND HANDY WORKS OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0170 AND BY THE SOLE IMPORTATION WHAT PRICE THEY PLEASE ON ALL FOREIGN COMMODITIES THE PEOPLE HAVE NEED OF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0171 BOTH WHICH ARE ILL FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE CONTRARY BY THE SOLE SELLING OF THE NATIVE COMMODITIES ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0172 AND SOLE BUYING THE FOREIGN COMMODITIES UPON THE PLACE THEY RAISE THE PRICE OF THOSE AND ABATE THE PRICE OF THESE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0173 TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE FOREIGNER FOR WHERE BUT ONE SELLETH THE MERCHANDISE IS THE DEARER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0174 AND WHERE BUT ONE BUYETH THE CHEAPER SUCH CORPORATIONS THEREFORE ARE NO OTHER THEN MONOPOLIES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0175 THOUGH THEY WOULD BE VERY PROFITABLE FOR A COMMON WEALTH IF BEING BOUND UP INTO ONE BODY IN FOREIGN MARKETS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0176 THEY WERE AT LIBERTY AT HOME EVERY MAN TO BUY AND SELL AT WHAT PRICE HE COULD
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0177 THE END THEN OF THESE BODIES OF MERCHANTS BEING NOT A COMMON BENEFIT TO THE WHOLE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0178 WHICH HAVE IN THIS CASE NO COMMON STOCK BUT WHAT IS DEDUCTED OUT OF THE PARTICULAR ADVENTURES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0179 FOR BUILDING BUYING VICTUALLING AND MANNING OF SHIPS BUT THE PARTICULAR GAIN OF EVERY ADVENTURER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0180 IT IS REASON THAT EVERY ONE BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF HIS OWN THAT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0181 IS THAT EVERY ONE BE OF THE ASSEMBLY THAT SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ORDER THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0182 AND BE ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR ACCOUNTS AND THEREFORE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH A BODY MUST BE AN ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0183 WHERE EVERY MEMBER OF THE BODY MAY BE PRESENT AT THE CONSULTATIONS IF HE WILL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0184 IF A BODY POLITIC OF MERCHANTS CONTRACT A DEBT TO A STRANGER BY THE ACT OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0185 EVERY MEMBER IS LIABLE BY HIMSELF FOR THE WHOLE FOR A STRANGER CAN TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEIR PRIVATE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0186 BUT CONSIDERETH THEM AS SO MANY PARTICULAR MEN OBLIGED EVERY ONE TO THE WHOLE PAYMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0187 TILL PAYMENT MADE BY ONE DISCHARGETH ALL THE REST BUT IF THE DEBT BE TO ONE OF THE COMPANY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0188 THE CREDITOR IS DEBTER FOR THE WHOLE TO HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0189 AND CANNOT THEREFORE DEMAND HIS DEBT BUT ONLY FROM THE COMMON STOCK IF THERE BE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0190 IF THE COMMON WEALTH IMPOSE A TAX UPON THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0191 IT IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE LAID UPON EVERY MEMBER PROPORTIONALLY TO HIS PARTICULAR ADVENTURE IN THE COMPANY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0192 FOR THERE IS IN THIS CASE NO OTHER COMMON STOCK BUT WHAT IS MADE OF THEIR PARTICULAR ADVENTURES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0193 IF A MULCT BE LAID UPON THE BODY FOR SOME UNLAWFUL ACT THEY ONLY ARE LIABLE BY WHOSE VOTES THE ACT WAS DECREED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0194 OR BY WHOSE ASSISTANCE IT WAS EXECUTED FOR IN NONE OF THE REST IS THERE ANY OTHER CRIME BUT BEING OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0195 WHICH IF A CRIME BECAUSE THE BODY WAS ORDAINED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0196 IS NOT HIS IF ONE OF THE MEMBERS BE INDEBTED TO THE BODY HE MAY BE SUED BY THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0197 BUT HIS GOODS CANNOT BE TAKEN NOR HIS PERSON IMPRISONED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0198 BUT ONLY BY AUTHORITY OF THE COMMON WEALTH FOR IF THEY CAN DOE IT BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0199 THEY CAN BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY GIVE JUDGMENT THAT THE DEBT IS DUE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0200 WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO BE JUDGE IN THEIR OWN CAUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0201 THESE BODIES MADE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF MEN OR OF TRAFFIC BE EITHER PERPETUAL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0202 OR FOR A TIME PRESCRIBED BY WRITING BUT THERE BE BODIES ALSO WHOSE TIMES ARE LIMITED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0203 AND THAT ONLY BY THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IF A SOVEREIGN MONARCH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0204 OR A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY SHALL THINK FIT TO GIVE COMMAND TO THE TOWNS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0205 AND OTHER SEVERAL PARTS OF THEIR TERRITORY TO SEND TO HIM THEIR DEPUTIES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0206 TO INFORM HIM OF THE CONDITION AND NECESSITIES OF THE SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0207 OR TO ADVISE WITH HIM FOR THE MAKING OF GOOD LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0208 OR FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE AS WITH ONE PERSON REPRESENTING THE WHOLE COUNTRY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0209 SUCH DEPUTIES HAVING A PLACE AND TIME OF MEETING ASSIGNED THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0210 ARE THERE AND AT THAT TIME A BODY POLITIC REPRESENTING EVERY SUBJECT OF THAT DOMINION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0211 BUT IT IS ONLY FOR SUCH MATTERS AS SHALL BE PROPOUNDED UNTO THEM BY THAT MAN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0212 OR ASSEMBLY THAT BY THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY SENT FOR THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0213 AND WHEN IT SHALL BE DECLARED THAT NOTHING MORE SHALL BE PROPOUNDED NOR DEBATED BY THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0214 THE BODY IS DISSOLVED FOR IF THEY WERE THE ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0215 THEN WERE IT THE SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY AND SO THERE WOULD BE TWO SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLIES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0216 OR TWO SOVEREIGNS OVER THE SAME PEOPLE WHICH CANNOT CONSIST WITH THEIR PEACE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0217 AND THEREFORE WHERE THERE IS ONCE A SOVEREIGNTY THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BUT BY IT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0218 AND FOR THE LIMITS OF HOW FAR SUCH A BODY SHALL REPRESENT THE WHOLE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0219 THEY ARE SET FORTH IN THE WRITING BY WHICH THEY WERE SENT FOR
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0220 FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT CHOOSE THEIR DEPUTIES TO OTHER INTENT THAN IS IN THE WRITING DIRECTED TO THEM FROM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXPRESSED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0221 PRIVATE BODIES REGULAR AND LAWFUL ARE THOSE THAT ARE CONSTITUTED WITHOUT LETTERS OR OTHER WRITTEN AUTHORITY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0222 SAVING THE LAWS COMMON TO ALL OTHER SUBJECTS AND BECAUSE THEY BE UNITED IN ONE PERSON REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0223 THEY ARE HELD FOR REGULAR SUCH AS ARE ALL FAMILIES IN WHICH THE FATHER OR MASTER ORDERETH THE WHOLE FAMILY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0224 FOR HE OBLIGETH HIS CHILDREN AND SERVANTS AS FAR AS THE LAW PERMITTETH THOUGH NOT FURTHER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0225 BECAUSE NONE OF THEM ARE BOUND TO OBEDIENCE IN THOSE ACTIONS WHICH THE LAW HATH FORBIDDEN TO BE DONE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0226 IN ALL OTHER ACTIONS DURING THE TIME THEY ARE UNDER DOMESTIC GOVERNMENT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR FATHERS AND MASTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0227 AS TO THEIR IMMEDIATE SOVEREIGNS FOR THE FATHER AND MASTER BEING BEFORE THE INSTITUTION OF COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0228 ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNS IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES THEY LOSE AFTERWARD NO MORE OF THEIR AUTHORITY THAN THE LAW OF THE COMMON WEALTH TAKETH FROM THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0229 PRIVATE BODIES REGULAR BUT UNLAWFUL ARE THOSE THAT UNITE THEMSELVES INTO ONE PERSON REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0230 WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC AUTHORITY AT ALL SUCH AS ARE THE CORPORATIONS OF BEGGARS THIEVES AND GYPSIES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0231 THE BETTER TO ORDER THEIR TRADE OF BEGGING AND STEALING AND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0232 THE CORPORATIONS OF MEN THAT BY AUTHORITY FROM ANY FOREIGN PERSON UNITE THEMSELVES IN ANOTHERS DOMINION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0233 FOR EASIER PROPAGATION OF DOCTRINES AND FOR MAKING A PARTY AGAINST THE POWER OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0234 IRREGULAR SYSTEMS IN THEIR NATURE BUT LEAGUES OR SOMETIMES MEER CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT UNION TO ANY PARTICULAR DESIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0235 NOT BY OBLIGATION OF ONE TO ANOTHER BUT PROCEEDING ONLY FROM A SIMILITUDE OF WILLS AND INCLINATIONS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0236 BECOME LAWFUL OR UNLAWFUL ACCORDING TO THE LAWFULNESS OR UNLAWFULNESS OF EVERY PARTICULAR MANS DESIGN THEREIN AND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0237 HIS DESIGN IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE OCCASION THE LEAGUES OF SUBJECTS BECAUSE LEAGUES ARE COMMONLY MADE FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0238 ARE IN A COMMON WEALTH WHICH IS NO MORE THAN A LEAGUE OF ALL THE SUBJECTS TOGETHER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0239 FOR THE MOST PART UNNECESSARY AND SAVOUR OF UNLAWFUL DESIGN AND ARE FOR THAT CAUSE UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0240 AND GO COMMONLY BY THE NAME OF FACTIONS OR CONSPIRACIES FOR A LEAGUE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0241 BEING A CONNEXION OF MEN BY COVENANTS IF THERE BE NO POWER GIVEN TO ANY ONE MAN OR ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0242 AS IN THE CONDITION OF MEER NATURE TO COMPEL THEM TO PERFORMANCE IS SO LONG ONLY VALID
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0243 AS THERE ARISETH NO JUST CAUSE OF DISTRUST AND THEREFORE LEAGUES BETWEEN COMMON WEALTHS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0244 OVER WHOM THERE IS NO HUMANE POWER ESTABLISHED TO KEEP THEM ALL IN AWE ARE NOT ONLY LAWFUL BUT ALSO PROFITABLE FOR THE TIME THEY LAST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0245 BUT LEAGUES OF THE SUBJECTS OF ONE AND THE SAME COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0246 WHERE EVERY ONE MAY OBTAIN HIS RIGHT BY MEANS OF THE SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0247 ARE UNNECESSARY TO THE MAINTAINING OF PEACE AND JUSTICE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0248 AND IN CASE THE DESIGN OF THEM BE EVIL OR UNKNOWN TO THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0249 UNLAWFUL FOR ALL UNITING OF STRENGTH BY PRIVATE MEN IS IF FOR EVIL INTENT UNJUST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0250 IF FOR INTENT UNKNOWN DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC AND UNJUSTLY CONCEALED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0251 IF THE SOVEREIGN POWER BE IN A GREAT ASSEMBLY AND A NUMBER OF MEN PART OF THE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0252 WITHOUT AUTHORITY CONSULT A PART TO CONTRIVE THE GUIDANCE OF THE REST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0253 THIS IS A FACTION OR CONSPIRACY UNLAWFUL AS BEING A FRAUDULENT SEDUCING OF THE ASSEMBLY FOR THEIR PARTICULAR INTEREST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0254 BUT IF HE WHOSE PRIVATE INTEREST IS TO BE DEBATED AND JUDGED IN THE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0255 MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS HE CAN IN HIM IT IS NO INJUSTICE BECAUSE IN THIS CASE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0256 HE IS NO PART OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THOUGH HE HIRE SUCH FRIENDS WITH MONEY UNLESS THERE BE AN EXPRESS LAW AGAINST IT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0257 YET IT IS NOT INJUSTICE FOR SOMETIMES AS MENS MANNERS ARE JUSTICE CANNOT BE HAD WITHOUT MONEY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0258 AND EVERY MAN MAY THINK HIS OWN CAUSE JUST TILL IT BE HEARD AND JUDGED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0259 IN ALL COMMON WEALTHS IF A PRIVATE MAN ENTERTAIN MORE SERVANTS THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS ESTATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0260 AND LAWFUL EMPLOYMENT HE HAS FOR THEM REQUIRES IT IS FACTION AND UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0261 FOR HAVING THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMON WEALTH HE NEEDETH NOT THE DEFENSE OF PRIVATE FORCE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0262 AND WHEREAS IN NATIONS NOT THOROUGHLY CIVILIZED SEVERAL NUMEROUS FAMILIES HAVE LIVED IN CONTINUAL HOSTILITY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0263 AND INVADED ONE ANOTHER WITH PRIVATE FORCE YET IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE DONE UNJUSTLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0264 OR ELSE THAT THEY HAD NO COMMON WEALTH AND AS FACTIONS FOR KINDRED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0265 SO ALSO FACTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT OF RELIGION AS OF PAPISTS PROTESTANTS ETCETERA
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0266 OR OF STATE AS PATRICIANS AND PLEBEIANS OF OLD TIME IN ROME
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0267 AND OF ARISTOCRATICALS AND DEMOCRATICALS OF OLD TIME IN GREECE ARE UNJUST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0268 AS BEING CONTRARY TO THE PEACE AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0269 AND A TAKING OF THE SWORD OUT OF THE HAND OF THE SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0270 CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE IS AN IRREGULAR SYSTEM THE LAWFULNESS OR UNLAWFULNESS WHEREOF DEPENDETH ON THE OCCASION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0271 AND ON THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE ASSEMBLED IF THE OCCASION BE LAWFUL AND MANIFEST
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0272 THE CONCOURSE IS LAWFUL AS THE USUAL MEETING OF MEN AT CHURCH OR AT A PUBLIC SHEW
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0273 IN USUAL NUMBERS FOR IF THE NUMBERS BE EXTRAORDINARILY GREAT THE OCCASION IS NOT EVIDENT AND CONSEQUENTLY HE THAT CANNOT RENDER A PARTICULAR AND GOOD ACCOUNT
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0274 OF HIS BEING AMONGST THEM IS TO BE JUDGED CONSCIOUS OF AN UNLAWFUL AND TUMULTUOUS DESIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0275 IT MAY BE LAWFUL FOR A THOUSAND MEN TO JOIN IN A PETITION TO BE DELIVERED TO A JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0276 YET IF A THOUSAND MEN COME TO PRESENT IT IT IS A TUMULTUOUS ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0277 BECAUSE THERE NEEDS BUT ONE OR TWO FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT IN SUCH CASES AS THESE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0278 IT IS NOT A SET NUMBER THAT MAKES THE ASSEMBLY UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0279 BUT SUCH A NUMBER AS THE PRESENT OFFICERS ARE NOT ABLE TO SUPPRESS AND BRING TO JUSTICE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0280 WHEN AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF MEN ASSEMBLE AGAINST A MAN WHOM THEY ACCUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0281 THE ASSEMBLY IS AN UNLAWFUL TUMULT BECAUSE THEY MAY DELIVER THEIR ACCUSATION TO THE MAGISTRATE BY A FEW
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0282 OR BY ONE MAN SUCH WAS THE CASE OF ST PAUL AT EPHESUS
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0283 WHERE DEMETRIUS AND A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER MEN BROUGHT TWO OF PAULS COMPANIONS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0284 SAYING WITH ONE VOYCE QUOTE GREAT IS DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS UNQUOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0285 WHICH WAS THEIR WAY OF DEMANDING JUSTICE AGAINST THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0286 FOR TEACHING THE PEOPLE SUCH DOCTRINE AS WAS AGAINST THEIR RELIGION AND TRADE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0287 THE OCCASION HERE CONSIDERING THE LAWS OF THAT PEOPLE WAS JUST YET WAS THEIR ASSEMBLY JUDGED UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0288 AND THE MAGISTRATE REPREHENDED THEM FOR IT IN THESE WORDS QUOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0289 IF DEMETRIUS AND THE OTHER WORK MEN CAN ACCUSE ANY MAN OF ANY THING
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0290 THERE BE PLEAS AND DEPUTIES LET THEM ACCUSE ONE ANOTHER AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THING TO DEMAND
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0291 YOUR CASE MAY BE JUDGED IN AN ASSEMBLY LAWFULLY CALLED
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0292 FOR WE ARE IN DANGER TO BE ACCUSED FOR THIS DAYS SEDITION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0293 BECAUSE THERE IS NO CAUSE BY WHICH ANY MAN CAN RENDER ANY REASON OF THIS CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0294 UNQUOTE WHERE HE CALLETH AN ASSEMBLY WHEREOF MEN CAN GIVE NO JUST ACCOUNT A SEDITION
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0295 AND SUCH AS THEY COULD NOT ANSWER FOR AND THIS IS ALL I SHALL SAY CONCERNING SYSTEMS AND ASSEMBLIES OF PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0296 WHICH MAY BE COMPARED AS I SAID TO THE SIMILAR PARTS OF MANS BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0297 SUCH AS BE LAWFUL TO THE MUSCLES SUCH AS ARE UNLAWFUL TO WENS BILES AND APOSTEMES
leonMire-20080526-lev/wav/lev0298 ENGENDERED BY THE UNNATURAL CONFLUX OF EVIL HUMOURS END OF CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
letsdothis-20080428-tfe/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION

librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0062 THERE STAND HIS TREES EACH WITH A HOLLOW TRUNK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0063 AS IF A HERMIT AND A CRUCIFIX WERE WITHIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0064 AND HERE SLEEPS HIS MEADOW AND THERE SLEEP HIS CATTLE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0065 AND UP FROM YONDER COTTAGE GOES A SLEEPY SMOKE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0066 DEEP INTO DISTANT WOODLANDS WINDS A MAZY WAY REACHING TO OVERLAPPING SPURS OF MOUNTAINS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0067 BATHED IN THEIR HILL SIDE BLUE BUT THOUGH THE PICTURE LIES THUS TRANCED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0068 AND THOUGH THIS PINE TREE SHAKES DOWN ITS SIGHS LIKE LEAVES UPON THIS SHEPHERD'S HEAD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0069 YET ALL WERE VAIN UNLESS THE SHEPHERD'S EYE WERE FIXED UPON THE MAGIC STREAM BEFORE HIM
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0070 GO VISIT THE PRAIRIES IN JUNE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0071 WHEN FOR SCORES ON SCORES OF MILES YOU WADE KNEE DEEP AMONG TIGER LILIES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0072 WHAT IS THE ONE CHARM WANTING WATER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0073 THERE IS NOT A DROP OF WATER THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0074 WERE NIAGARA BUT A CATARACT OF SAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0075 WOULD YOU TRAVEL YOUR THOUSAND MILES TO SEE IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0076 WHY DID THE POOR POET OF TENNESSEE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0077 UPON SUDDENLY RECEIVING TWO HANDFULS OF SILVER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0078 DELIBERATE WHETHER TO BUY HIM A COAT WHICH HE SADLY NEEDED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0079 OR INVEST HIS MONEY IN A PEDESTRIAN TRIP TO ROCKAWAY BEACH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0080 WHY IS ALMOST EVERY ROBUST HEALTHY BOY WITH A ROBUST HEALTHY SOUL IN HIM
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0081 AT SOME TIME OR OTHER CRAZY TO GO TO SEA
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0082 WHY UPON YOUR FIRST VOYAGE AS A PASSENGER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0083 DID YOU YOURSELF FEEL SUCH A MYSTICAL VIBRATION
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0084 WHEN FIRST TOLD THAT YOU AND YOUR SHIP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0085 WERE NOW OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0086 WHY DID THE OLD PERSIANS HOLD THE SEA HOLY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0087 WHY DID THE GREEKS GIVE IT A SEPARATE DEITY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0088 AND OWN BROTHER OF JOVE SURELY ALL THIS IS NOT WITHOUT MEANING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0089 AND STILL DEEPER THE MEANING OF THAT STORY OF NARCISSUS WHO BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GRASP THE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0090 TORMENTING MILD IMAGE HE SAW IN THE FOUNTAIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0091 PLUNGED INTO IT AND WAS DROWNED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0092 BUT THAT SAME IMAGE WE OURSELVES SEE IN ALL RIVERS AND OCEANS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0093 IT IS THE IMAGE OF THE UNGRASPABLE PHANTOM OF LIFE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0094 AND THIS IS THE KEY TO IT ALL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0095 NOW WHEN I SAY THAT I AM IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO SEA WHENEVER I BEGIN TO GROW HAZY ABOUT THE EYES AND BEGIN TO BE OVER CONSCIOUS OF MY LUNGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0096 I DO NOT MEAN TO HAVE IT INFERRED THAT I EVER GO TO SEA AS A PASSENGER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0097 FOR TO GO AS A PASSENGER YOU MUST NEEDS HAVE A PURSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0098 AND A PURSE IS BUT A RAG UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0099 BESIDES PASSENGERS GET SEA SICK GROW QUARRELSOME DON'T SLEEP OF NIGHTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0100 DO NOT ENJOY THEMSELVES MUCH AS A GENERAL THING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0101 NO I NEVER GO AS A PASSENGER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0102 NOR THOUGH I AM SOMETHING OF A SALT DO I EVER GO TO SEA AS A COMMODORE OR A CAPTAIN OR A COOK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0103 I ABANDON THE GLORY AND DISTINCTION OF SUCH OFFICES TO THOSE WHO LIKE THEM FOR MY PART I ABOMINATE ALL HONOURABLE RESPECTABLE TOILS TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF EVERY KIND WHATSOEVER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0104 IT IS QUITE AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF WITHOUT TAKING CARE OF SHIPS BARQUES BRIGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0105 SCHOONERS AND WHAT NOT AND AS FOR GOING AS COOK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0106 THOUGH I CONFESS THERE IS CONSIDERABLE GLORY IN THAT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0107 A COOK BEING A SORT OF OFFICER ON SHIP BOARD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0108 YET SOMEHOW I NEVER FANCIED BROILING FOWLS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0109 THOUGH ONCE BROILED JUDICIOUSLY BUTTERED AND JUDGMATICALLY SALTED AND PEPPERED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0110 THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL SPEAK MORE RESPECTFULLY NOT TO SAY REVERENTIALLY OF A BROILED FOWL THAN I WILL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0111 IT IS OUT OF THE IDOLATROUS DOTINGS OF THE OLD EGYPTIANS UPON BROILED IBIS AND ROASTED RIVER HORSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0112 THAT YOU SEE THE MUMMIES OF THOSE CREATURES IN THEIR HUGE BAKE HOUSES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0113 THE PYRAMIDS NO WHEN I GO TO SEA I GO AS A SIMPLE SAILOR RIGHT BEFORE THE MAST
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0114 PLUMB DOWN INTO THE FORECASTLE ALOFT THERE TO THE ROYAL MAST HEAD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0115 TRUE THEY RATHER ORDER ME ABOUT SOME AND MAKE ME JUMP FROM SPAR TO SPAR LIKE A GRASSHOPPER IN A MAY MEADOW AND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0116 AT FIRST THIS SORT OF THING IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IT TOUCHES ONE'S SENSE OF HONOUR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0117 PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME OF AN OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILY IN THE LAND THE VAN RENSSELAERS OR RANDOLPHS OR HARDICANUTES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0118 AND MORE THAN ALL IF JUST PREVIOUS TO PUTTING YOUR HAND INTO THE TAR POT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0119 YOU HAVE BEEN LORDING IT AS A COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0120 MAKING THE TALLEST BOYS STAND IN AWE OF YOU
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0121 THE TRANSITION IS A KEEN ONE I ASSURE YOU FROM A SCHOOLMASTER TO A SAILOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0122 AND REQUIRES A STRONG DECOCTION OF SENECA AND THE STOICS TO ENABLE YOU TO GRIN AND BEAR IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0123 BUT EVEN THIS WEARS OFF IN TIME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0124 WHAT OF IT IF SOME OLD HUNKS OF A SEA CAPTAIN ORDERS ME TO GET A BROOM AND SWEEP DOWN THE DECKS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0125 WHAT DOES THAT INDIGNITY AMOUNT TO WEIGHED I MEAN IN THE SCALES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0126 DO YOU THINK THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL THINKS ANYTHING THE LESS OF ME BECAUSE I PROMPTLY AND RESPECTFULLY OBEY THAT OLD HUNKS IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0127 WHO AIN'T A SLAVE TELL ME THAT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0128 WELL THEN HOWEVER THE OLD SEA CAPTAINS MAY ORDER ME ABOUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0129 HOWEVER THEY MAY THUMP AND PUNCH ME ABOUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0130 I HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT IT IS ALL RIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0131 THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS ONE WAY OR OTHER SERVED IN MUCH THE SAME WAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0132 EITHER IN A PHYSICAL OR METAPHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT IS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0133 AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP IS PASSED ROUND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0134 AND ALL HANDS SHOULD RUB EACH OTHER'S SHOULDER BLADES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0135 AND BE CONTENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0136 AGAIN I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE THEY MAKE A POINT OF PAYING ME FOR MY TROUBLE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0137 WHEREAS THEY NEVER PAY PASSENGERS A SINGLE PENNY THAT I EVER HEARD OF ON THE CONTRARY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES MUST PAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0138 AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYING AND BEING PAID
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0139 THE ACT OF PAYING IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE INFLICTION THAT THE TWO ORCHARD THIEVES ENTAILED UPON US
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0140 BUT BEING PAID WHAT WILL COMPARE WITH IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0141 THE URBANE ACTIVITY WITH WHICH A MAN RECEIVES MONEY IS REALLY MARVELLOUS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0142 CONSIDERING THAT WE SO EARNESTLY BELIEVE MONEY TO BE THE ROOT OF ALL EARTHLY ILLS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0143 AND THAT ON NO ACCOUNT CAN A MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVEN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0144 AH HOW CHEERFULLY WE CONSIGN OURSELVES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0145 TO PERDITION FINALLY I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLESOME EXERCISE AND PURE AIR OF THE FORE CASTLE DECK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0146 FOR AS IN THIS WORLD HEAD WINDS ARE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN WINDS FROM ASTERN THAT IS IF YOU NEVER VIOLATE THE PYTHAGOREAN MAXIM
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0147 SO FOR THE MOST PART THE COMMODORE ON THE QUARTER DECK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0148 GETS HIS ATMOSPHERE AT SECOND HAND FROM THE SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0149 HE THINKS HE BREATHES IT FIRST BUT NOT SO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0150 IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DO THE COMMONALTY LEAD THEIR LEADERS IN MANY OTHER THINGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0151 AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0152 BUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING REPEATEDLY SMELT THE SEA AS A MERCHANT SAILOR I SHOULD NOW TAKE IT INTO MY HEAD TO GO ON A WHALING VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0153 THIS THE INVISIBLE POLICE OFFICER OF THE FATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0154 WHO HAS THE CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF ME AND SECRETLY DOGS ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0155 AND INFLUENCES ME IN SOME UNACCOUNTABLE WAY HE CAN BETTER ANSWER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0156 THAN ANY ONE ELSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0157 AND DOUBTLESS MY GOING ON THIS WHALING VOYAGE FORMED PART OF THE GRAND PROGRAMME OF PROVIDENCE THAT WAS DRAWN UP A LONG TIME AGO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0158 IT CAME IN AS A SORT OF BRIEF INTERLUDE AND SOLO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0159 BETWEEN MORE EXTENSIVE PERFORMANCES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0160 I TAKE IT THAT THIS PART OF THE BILL MUST HAVE RUN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0161 GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0162 WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL BLOODY BATTLE IN AFGHANISTAN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0163 THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY IT WAS EXACTLY THAT THOSE STAGE MANAGERS THE FATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0164 PUT ME DOWN FOR THIS SHABBY PART OF A WHALING VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0165 WHEN OTHERS WERE SET DOWN FOR MAGNIFICENT PARTS IN HIGH TRAGEDIES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0166 AND SHORT AND EASY PARTS IN GENTEEL COMEDIES AND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0167 JOLLY PARTS IN FARCES THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY THIS WAS EXACTLY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0168 YET NOW THAT I RECALL ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0169 I THINK I CAN SEE A LITTLE INTO THE SPRINGS AND MOTIVES WHICH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0170 BEING CUNNINGLY PRESENTED TO ME UNDER VARIOUS DISGUISES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0171 INDUCED ME TO SET ABOUT PERFORMING THE PART I DID
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0172 BESIDES CAJOLING ME INTO THE DELUSION THAT IT WAS A CHOICE RESULTING FROM MY OWN UNBIASED FREEWILL AND DISCRIMINATING JUDGMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0173 CHIEF AMONG THESE MOTIVES WAS THE OVERWHELMING IDEA OF THE GREAT WHALE HIMSELF
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0174 SUCH A PORTENTOUS AND MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ROUSED ALL MY CURIOSITY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0175 THEN THE WILD AND DISTANT SEAS WHERE HE ROLLED HIS ISLAND BULK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0176 THE UNDELIVERABLE NAMELESS PERILS OF THE WHALE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0177 THESE WITH ALL THE ATTENDING MARVELS OF A THOUSAND PATAGONIAN SIGHTS AND SOUNDS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0178 HELPED TO SWAY ME TO MY WISH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0179 WITH OTHER MEN PERHAPS SUCH THINGS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INDUCEMENTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0180 BUT AS FOR ME I AM TORMENTED WITH AN EVERLASTING ITCH FOR THINGS REMOTE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0181 I LOVE TO SAIL FORBIDDEN SEAS AND LAND ON BARBAROUS COASTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0182 NOT IGNORING WHAT IS GOOD I AM QUICK TO PERCEIVE A HORROR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0183 AND COULD STILL BE SOCIAL WITH IT WOULD THEY LET ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0184 SINCE IT IS BUT WELL TO BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ALL THE INMATES OF THE PLACE ONE LODGES IN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0185 BY REASON OF THESE THINGS THEN THE WHALING VOYAGE WAS WELCOME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0186 THE GREAT FLOOD GATES OF THE WONDER WORLD SWUNG OPEN AND IN THE WILD CONCEITS THAT SWAYED ME TO MY PURPOSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0187 TWO AND TWO THERE FLOATED INTO MY INMOST SOUL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0188 ENDLESS PROCESSIONS OF THE WHALE AND MID MOST OF THEM ALL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0189 ONE GRAND HOODED PHANTOM LIKE A SNOW HILL IN THE AIR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0190 CHAPTER TWO THE CARPET BAG
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0191 I STUFFED A SHIRT OR TWO INTO MY OLD CARPET BAG TUCKED IT UNDER MY ARM AND STARTED FOR CAPE HORN AND THE PACIFIC
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0192 QUITTING THE GOOD CITY OF OLD MANHATTO I DULY ARRIVED IN NEW BEDFORD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0193 IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT IN DECEMBER MUCH WAS I DISAPPOINTED UPON LEARNING THAT THE LITTLE PACKET FOR NANTUCKET HAD ALREADY SAILED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0194 AND THAT NO WAY OF REACHING THAT PLACE WOULD OFFER TILL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0195 AS MOST YOUNG CANDIDATES FOR THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF WHALING STOP AT THIS SAME NEW BEDFORD THENCE TO EMBARK ON THEIR VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0196 IT MAY AS WELL BE RELATED THAT I FOR ONE HAD NO IDEA OF SO DOING FOR MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO SAIL IN NO OTHER THAN A NANTUCKET CRAFT BECAUSE THERE WAS A FINE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0197 BOISTEROUS SOMETHING ABOUT EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THAT FAMOUS OLD ISLAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0198 WHICH AMAZINGLY PLEASED ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0199 BESIDES THOUGH NEW BEDFORD HAS OF LATE BEEN GRADUALLY MONOPOLISING THE BUSINESS OF WHALING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0200 AND THOUGH IN THIS MATTER POOR OLD NANTUCKET IS NOW MUCH BEHIND HER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0201 YET NANTUCKET WAS HER GREAT ORIGINAL THE TYRE OF THIS CARTHAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0202 THE PLACE WHERE THE FIRST DEAD AMERICAN WHALE WAS STRANDED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0203 WHERE ELSE BUT FROM NANTUCKET DID THOSE ABORIGINAL WHALEMEN THE RED MEN FIRST SALLY OUT IN CANOES TO GIVE CHASE TO THE LEVIATHAN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0204 AND WHERE BUT FROM NANTUCKET TOO DID THAT FIRST ADVENTUROUS LITTLE SLOOP PUT FORTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0205 PARTLY LADEN WITH IMPORTED COBBLESTONES SO GOES THE STORY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0206 TO THROW AT THE WHALES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0207 IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WHEN THEY WERE NIGH ENOUGH TO RISK A HARPOON FROM THE BOWSPRIT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0208 NOW HAVING A NIGHT A DAY AND STILL ANOTHER NIGHT FOLLOWING BEFORE ME IN NEW BEDFORD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0209 ERE I COULD EMBARK FOR MY DESTINED PORT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0210 IT BECAME A MATTER OF CONCERNMENT WHERE I WAS TO EAT AND SLEEP MEANWHILE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0211 IT WAS A VERY DUBIOUS LOOKING NAY A VERY DARK AND DISMAL NIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0212 BITINGLY COLD AND CHEERLESS I KNEW NO ONE IN THE PLACE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0213 WITH ANXIOUS GRAPNELS I HAD SOUNDED MY POCKET AND ONLY BROUGHT UP A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0214 SO WHEREVER YOU GO ISHMAEL SAID I TO MYSELF AS I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A DREARY STREET SHOULDERING MY BAG
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0215 AND COMPARING THE GLOOM TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE SOUTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0216 WHEREVER IN YOUR WISDOM YOU MAY CONCLUDE TO LODGE FOR THE NIGHT MY DEAR ISHMAEL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0217 BE SURE TO INQUIRE THE PRICE AND DON'T BE TOO PARTICULAR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0218 WITH HALTING STEPS I PACED THE STREETS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0219 AND PASSED THE SIGN OF THE CROSSED HARPOONS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0220 BUT IT LOOKED TOO EXPENSIVE AND JOLLY THERE FURTHER ON FROM THE BRIGHT RED WINDOWS OF THE SWORD FISH INN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0221 THERE CAME SUCH FERVENT RAYS THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE MELTED THE PACKED SNOW AND ICE FROM BEFORE THE HOUSE FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE THE CONGEALED FROST LAY TEN INCHES THICK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0222 IN A HARD ASPHALTIC PAVEMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0223 RATHER WEARY FOR ME WHEN I STRUCK MY FOOT AGAINST THE FLINTY PROJECTIONS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0224 BECAUSE FROM HARD REMORSELESS SERVICE THE SOLES OF MY BOOTS WERE IN A MOST MISERABLE PLIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0225 TOO EXPENSIVE AND JOLLY AGAIN THOUGHT I
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0226 PAUSING ONE MOMENT TO WATCH THE BROAD GLARE IN THE STREET AND HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE TINKLING GLASSES WITHIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0227 BUT GO ON ISHMAEL SAID I AT LAST DON'T YOU HEAR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0228 GET AWAY FROM BEFORE THE DOOR YOUR PATCHED BOOTS ARE STOPPING THE WAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0229 SO ON I WENT I NOW BY INSTINCT FOLLOWED THE STREETS THAT TOOK ME WATERWARD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0230 FOR THERE DOUBTLESS WERE THE CHEAPEST IF NOT THE CHEERIEST INNS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0231 SUCH DREARY STREETS BLOCKS OF BLACKNESS NOT HOUSES ON EITHER HAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0232 AND HERE AND THERE A CANDLE LIKE A CANDLE MOVING ABOUT IN A TOMB
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0233 AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0234 OF THE LAST DAY OF THE WEEK THAT QUARTER OF THE TOWN PROVED ALL BUT DESERTED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0235 BUT PRESENTLY I CAME TO A SMOKY LIGHT PROCEEDING FROM A LOW WIDE BUILDING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0236 THE DOOR OF WHICH STOOD INVITINGLY OPEN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0237 IT HAD A CARELESS LOOK AS IF IT WERE MEANT FOR THE USES OF THE PUBLIC
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0238 SO ENTERING THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO STUMBLE OVER AN ASH BOX IN THE PORCH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0239 HA THOUGHT I HA AS THE FLYING PARTICLES ALMOST CHOKED ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0240 ARE THESE ASHES FROM THAT DESTROYED CITY GOMORRAH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0241 BUT THE CROSSED HARPOONS AND THE SWORD FISH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0242 THIS THEN MUST NEEDS BE THE SIGN OF THE TRAP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0243 HOWEVER I PICKED MYSELF UP AND HEARING A LOUD VOICE WITHIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0244 PUSHED ON AND OPENED A SECOND INTERIOR DOOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0245 IT SEEMED THE GREAT BLACK PARLIAMENT SITTING IN TOPHET
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0246 A HUNDRED BLACK FACES TURNED ROUND IN THEIR ROWS TO PEER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0247 AND BEYOND A BLACK ANGEL OF DOOM WAS BEATING A BOOK IN A PULPIT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0248 IT WAS A NEGRO CHURCH AND THE PREACHER'S TEXT WAS ABOUT THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0249 AND THE WEEPING AND WAILING AND TEETH GNASHING THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0250 HA ISHMAEL MUTTERED I BACKING OUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0251 WRETCHED ENTERTAINMENT AT THE SIGN OF THE TRAP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0252 MOVING ON I AT LAST CAME TO A DIM SORT OF LIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0253 NOT FAR FROM THE DOCKS AND HEARD A FORLORN CREAKING IN THE AIR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0254 AND LOOKING UP SAW A SWINGING SIGN OVER THE DOOR WITH A WHITE PAINTING UPON IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0255 FAINTLY REPRESENTING A TALL STRAIGHT JET OF MISTY SPRAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0256 AND THESE WORDS UNDERNEATH THE SPOUTER INN PETER COFFIN COFFIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0257 SPOUTER RATHER OMINOUS IN THAT PARTICULAR CONNEXION THOUGHT I
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0258 BUT IT IS A COMMON NAME IN NANTUCKET THEY SAY AND I SUPPOSE THIS PETER HERE IS AN EMIGRANT FROM THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0259 AS THE LIGHT LOOKED SO DIM AND THE PLACE FOR THE TIME LOOKED QUIET ENOUGH AND THE DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE ITSELF LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CARTED HERE FROM THE RUINS OF SOME BURNT DISTRICT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0260 AND AS THE SWINGING SIGN HAD A POVERTY STRICKEN SORT OF CREAK TO IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0261 I THOUGHT THAT HERE WAS THE VERY SPOT FOR CHEAP LODGINGS AND THE BEST OF PEA COFFEE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0262 IT WAS A QUEER SORT OF PLACE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0263 A GABLE ENDED OLD HOUSE ONE SIDE PALSIED AS IT WERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0264 AND LEANING OVER SADLY IT STOOD ON A SHARP BLEAK CORNER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0265 WHERE THAT TEMPESTUOUS WIND EUROCLYDON KEPT UP A WORSE HOWLING THAN EVER IT DID ABOUT POOR PAUL'S TOSSED CRAFT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0266 EUROCLYDON NEVERTHELESS IS A MIGHTY PLEASANT ZEPHYR TO ANY ONE IN DOORS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0267 WITH HIS FEET ON THE HOB QUIETLY TOASTING FOR BED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0268 IN JUDGING OF THAT TEMPESTUOUS WIND CALLED EUROCLYDON SAYS AN OLD WRITER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0269 OF WHOSE WORKS I POSSESS THE ONLY COPY EXTANT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0270 IT MAKETH A MARVELLOUS DIFFERENCE WHETHER THOU LOOKEST OUT AT IT FROM A GLASS WINDOW WHERE THE FROST IS ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0271 OR WHETHER THOU OBSERVEST IT FROM THAT SASHLESS WINDOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0272 WHERE THE FROST IS ON BOTH SIDES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0273 AND OF WHICH THE WIGHT DEATH IS THE ONLY GLAZIER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0274 TRUE ENOUGH THOUGHT I AS THIS PASSAGE OCCURRED TO MY MIND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0275 OLD BLACK LETTER THOU REASONEST WELL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0276 YES THESE EYES ARE WINDOWS AND THIS BODY OF MINE IS THE HOUSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0277 WHAT A PITY THEY DIDN'T STOP UP THE CHINKS AND THE CRANNIES THOUGH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0278 AND THRUST IN A LITTLE LINT HERE AND THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0279 BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENTS NOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0280 THE UNIVERSE IS FINISHED THE COPESTONE IS ON
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0281 AND THE CHIPS WERE CARTED OFF A MILLION YEARS AGO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0282 POOR LAZARUS THERE CHATTERING HIS TEETH AGAINST THE CURBSTONE FOR HIS PILLOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0283 AND SHAKING OFF HIS TATTERS WITH HIS SHIVERINGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0284 HE MIGHT PLUG UP BOTH EARS WITH RAGS AND PUT A CORN COB INTO HIS MOUTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0285 AND YET THAT WOULD NOT KEEP OUT THE TEMPESTUOUS EUROCLYDON
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0286 EUROCLYDON SAYS OLD DIVES IN HIS RED SILKEN WRAPPER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0287 HE HAD A REDDER ONE AFTERWARDS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0288 POOH POOH WHAT A FINE FROSTY NIGHT HOW ORION GLITTERS WHAT NORTHERN LIGHTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0289 LET THEM TALK OF THEIR ORIENTAL SUMMER CLIMES OF EVERLASTING CONSERVATORIES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0290 GIVE ME THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING MY OWN SUMMER WITH MY OWN COALS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0291 BUT WHAT THINKS LAZARUS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0292 CAN HE WARM HIS BLUE HANDS BY HOLDING THEM UP TO THE GRAND NORTHERN LIGHTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0293 WOULD NOT LAZARUS RATHER BE IN SUMATRA THAN HERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0294 WOULD HE NOT FAR RATHER LAY HIM DOWN LENGTHWISE ALONG THE LINE OF THE EQUATOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0295 YEA YE GODS GO DOWN TO THE FIERY PIT ITSELF IN ORDER TO KEEP OUT THIS FROST
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0296 NOW THAT LAZARUS SHOULD LIE STRANDED THERE ON THE CURBSTONE BEFORE THE DOOR OF DIVES THIS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0297 IS MORE WONDERFUL THAN THAT AN ICEBERG SHOULD BE MOORED TO ONE OF THE MOLUCCAS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0298 YET DIVES HIMSELF HE TOO LIVES LIKE A CZAR IN AN ICE PALACE MADE OF FROZEN SIGHS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0299 AND BEING A PRESIDENT OF A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0300 HE ONLY DRINKS THE TEPID TEARS OF ORPHANS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0301 BUT NO MORE OF THIS BLUBBERING NOW WE ARE GOING A WHALING AND THERE IS PLENTY OF THAT YET TO COME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0302 LET US SCRAPE THE ICE FROM OUR FROSTED FEET
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0303 AND SEE WHAT SORT OF A PLACE THIS SPOUTER MAY BE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB/wav/mob0304 END OF CHAPTERS ONE AND TWO
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY

life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
life4himsq-20080807-vvt/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS

life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
life4himsq-20080807-xne/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
lindacrisan-20091116-cgx/wav/a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
lindavg-20081007-adc/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT

lindavg-20081007-ahj/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
lindavg-20081007-cqp/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
lindavg-20081007-eym/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
lindavg-20081007-fap/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
lindavg-20081007-heh/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
lindavg-20081007-jyk/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
lindavg-20081007-lxd/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
lindavg-20081007-ocy/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
lindavg-20081007-ovc/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
lindavg-20081007-oyi/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
lindavg-20081007-snd/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
lindavg-20081007-trz/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
lindavg-20081007-wxe/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
lindavg-20081007-wyi/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
linforcer-20080504-plx/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK CRASH CAME
LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
LMA-20091008-uhh/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-1 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-2 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-4 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-5 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-6 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
locked-20080927-cc/wav/cc-7 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR

Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
Luca-20091217-zis/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
LukeSkywalker-20090509-sni/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF

lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
lukespearcouk-20081023-cao/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL

lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI

lukespearcouk-20081023-cdl/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
lukespearcouk-20081023-twr/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
LunaTick-20080319-ill/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
LunaTick-20080319-owg/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
LunaTick-20080319-oyi/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE

LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-1 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-2 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-3 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-4 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-5 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-6 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-7 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-8 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
LunaTick-20080326-cc/wav/cc-9 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-1 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-2 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-3 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-4 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-5 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-6 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-7 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-8 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
LunaTick-20080326-rp/wav/rp-9 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-10 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-1 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-2 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-3 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-40 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-4 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-5 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-6 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-7 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-8 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
LunaTick-20080329-vf1/wav/vf1-9 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-10 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-11 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-12 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-13 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-14 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-15 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-16 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-17 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-18 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-19 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-1 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-20 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-21 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-22 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-23 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-24 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-25 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-26 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-27 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-28 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-29 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-2 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-30 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-31 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-32 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-33 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-34 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-35 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-36 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-37 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-38 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-39 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-3 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-40 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-4 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-5 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-6 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-7 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-8 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/wav/vf2-9 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-1 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-2 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-3 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-4 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-5 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-6 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-7 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-8 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/wav/vf3-9 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-1 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-2 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-3 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-4 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-5 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-6 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-7 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-8 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
LunaTick-20080410-vf10/wav/vf10-9 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-1 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-2 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-3 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-4 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-5 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-6 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-7 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-8 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/wav/vf4-9 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-1 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-2 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-3 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-4 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-5 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-6 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-7 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-8 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/wav/vf5-9 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-16 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-1 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-21 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-22 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-23 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-24 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-25 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-26 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-27 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-28 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-29 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-2 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-30 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-31 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-32 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-33 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-34 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-35 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-36 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-37 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-38 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-39 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-3 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-40 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-4 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-5 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-6 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-7 HOW MUCH WAS IT
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-8 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
LunaTick-20080410-vf6/wav/vf6-9 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-10 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-11 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-12 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-13 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-14 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-15 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-16 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-17 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-18 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-19 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-1 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-20 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-21 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-22 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-23 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-24 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-25 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-26 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-27 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-28 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-29 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-2 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-31 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-36 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-3 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-4 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-5 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-6 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-7 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-8 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
LunaTick-20080410-vf7/wav/vf7-9 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
LunaTick-20080908-kca/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
lyndsey-20080305-gyx/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0475 ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
maarten-20090512-vpt/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
mahasamoot-20070718-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
mahasamoot-20070719-ar/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-14 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-35 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-36 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-37 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-39 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19/wav/vf19-40 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
majiq-20090809-imi/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL

majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
majiq-20090811-iqx/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
majiq-20090811-kme/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
majiq-20090812-ktk/wav/b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL

Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Mariane-20090907-ava/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL

Mariane-20090907-awv/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
Mariane-20090907-awv/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
Mariane-20090907-awv/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
Mariane-20090907-awv/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
Mariane-20090907-ben/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Mariane-20090907-hsy/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
Mariane-20090907-ifu/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
Mariane-20090907-jqm/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
Mariane-20090907-lgp/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Mariane-20090907-lho/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
Mariane-20090907-ogq/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
Mariane-20090907-uqf/wav/b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
Mariane-20090908-dtb/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Mariane-20090908-gaq/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Mariane-20090908-sxp/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
Mariane-20090910-cyd/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
Mariane-20090910-pfb/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
mariodsantana-20090427-puq/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0132 OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0133 BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0134 THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0136 EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0137 HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0139 HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0140 A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
markowe-20081210-qjt/wav/a0141 STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0109 ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0111 CONTINUED AT DAWN
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0112 PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0113 PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0114 HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0115 NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
markowe-20081210-riz/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0086 COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0087 BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0088 SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0089 GLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0090 SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0091 GREW HOT RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0092 MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
markowe-20081210-ynp/wav/a0095 CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
Mark_Reynolds-20070531-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
matt-20080101-ksu/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
Matteo-20081117-dpq/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
Matteo-20081117-zev/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
MattGorle-20091120-iaj/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
MattGorle-20091120-jjg/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
MC-20090127-kuj/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
mcmurray02-20090312-avd/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
mcmurray02-20090312-joh/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
mcmurray02-20090312-jyx/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
mcmurray02-20090312-lje/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0190 TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
mcmurray02-20090312-pza/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
mcmurray02-20090312-sie/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
mcmurray02-20090312-sox/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
mcmurray02-20090312-zke/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
mdm-20080822-dfo/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
mdm-20080822-gdd/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE

Melissa-20081211-ehn/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM

Melissa-20081211-ehn/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST

Melissa-20081211-qhg/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Melissa-20081211-qhg/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Melissa-20081211-qhg/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Melissa-20081211-qhg/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Melissa-20081211-qhg/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER

mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK

mgfletcher-20080126-fpb/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
mgmiller-20080319-fma/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN

mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
mgmiller-20080319-hvm/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mgmiller-20080319-irt/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
mgmiller-20080319-nea/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR

mgmiller-20080319-nea/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
mgmiller-20080319-nea/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER

mgmiller-20080319-nea/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
mgmiller-20080319-neg/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
mgmiller-20080319-neg/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES

mgmiller-20080319-neg/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
mgmiller-20080319-neg/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
mgmiller-20080319-neg/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mgmiller-20080319-ows/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
mgmiller-20080319-srh/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL

mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
mgmiller-20080319-toq/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
mgmiller-20080319-vtf/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW

mgmiller-20080319-vtf/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME

mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY

Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
Mike-20081006-bym/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED

Mike-20081010-gmj/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
Mike-20081010-gmj/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
Mike-20081010-gmj/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
Mike-20081010-igv/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
mike-20091218-cbk/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
Mindseye-20071101-csn/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS

montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA

montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
montana-20091129-dme/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
montana-20091129-gpa/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
montana-20091129-usu/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mouhamedyousef-20090303-eqo/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE THEN THEY COME TOGETHER
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
MrOverclock-20081204-ntu/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
MSypkensSmit-20080802-xda/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ctf/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rjg/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-rlf/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
MSypkensSmit-20080803-ywv/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
Muuker-20080129-onw/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
Muuker-20080129-onw/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
Muuker-20080129-onw/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
Muuker-20080129-onw/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
Muuker-20080129-onw/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
mwalma-20080112/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
n2k-20090202-udz/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0435 WELL THEY DID EAT
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANT
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
nalbion-20081027-fxc/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
nalbion-20081027-tkn/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
nalbion-20081027-xft/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
nalbion-20081027-yqy/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
NanaHuck-20080321-buf/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
NanaHuck-20080321-ctr/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
NanaHuck-20080321-ijk/wav/a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
Nathan-20090324-ova/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH-KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
necrose99-20080308-khs/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
necrose99-20080308-wvg/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME

Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
Ned-20080204-cyx/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE

neonard0-20080926-hfa/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
neonard0-20080926-hfa/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
neonard0-20080926-hfa/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES

neonard0-20080926-hfa/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
nestea247-20080301-rkx/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
nestea247-20080301-sbn/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
nestea247-20080301-sbn/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME

nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
nestea247-20080301-zmy/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
netjunki-20081204-orf/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
neuralnet-20080702-dfq/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
neuralnet-20080702-fgc/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
neuralnet-20080702-jjw/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
neuralnet-20080702-jvy/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA

neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
neuralnet-20080702-rmy/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
neuralnet-20080702-uil/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
neuralnet-20080702-wuu/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
neuralnet-20080702-wxj/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
neuralnet-20080702-xkk/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
neuralnet-20080702-xwd/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
neuralnet-20080702-yfh/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
neuralnet-20090503-tua/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
neuralnet-20090503-xkf/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
neuralnet-20090605-nbc/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
neuralnet-20090811-cwg/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN

nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
nilesuk-20090217-tet/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
ninghuajiang-20071216-pku/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
nizar-20080511-xyk/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
nollidj-20081101-ar/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
nollidj-20081101-cc/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
nollidj-20081101-rp/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-01 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-02 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-03 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-04 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-05 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-06 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-07 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-08 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-09 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-10 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
nollidj-20081101-vf1/wav/vf1-40 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
noman-20080322-vtn/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
noman-20080322-vtn/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
noman-20080322-vtn/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
noman-20080322-vtn/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS

oeginc-20080224-oao/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES

oeginc-20080224-oao/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW

oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
oeginc-20080228-zco/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER

ojfl-20080303-kyt/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
ojfl-20080303-kyt/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
ojfl-20080303-kyt/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
ojfl-20080303-qrb/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
ojfl-20080303-ziv/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
orca-20070706/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
orca-20070706/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
orca-20070706/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
orca-20070706/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
orca-20070706/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
orca-20070706/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
orca-20070706/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
orca-20070706/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
orca-20070706/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
orca-20070706/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
orca-20070706/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
orca-20070706/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
orca-20070706/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
orca-20070706/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
orca-20070706/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
orca-20070706/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
orca-20070706/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
orca-20070706/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
orca-20070706/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
orca-20070706/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
orca-20070706/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
orca-20070706/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
orca-20070706/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
orca-20070706/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
orca-20070706/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
orca-20070706/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
orca-20070706/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
orca-20070706/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
orca-20070706/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
orca-20070706/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
orca-20070706/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
orca-20070706/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
orca-20070706/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

paddy-20080911-bua/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
paddy-20080911-bua/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM

paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD

paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED

paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
paddy-20080911-crt/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED

paddy-20080911-eeo/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
paddy-20080911-eeo/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY

paddy-20080911-hun/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
paddy-20080911-hun/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
paddy-20080911-hun/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT

paddy-20080911-hun/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
paddy-20080911-jbe/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD

panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
panrubius-20090904-xie/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
Paolino-20081021-hgz/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
parent5446-20090726/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
parent5446-20090726/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
parent5446-20090726/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
patmo-20080225-qpb/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY

patmo-20080225-qpb/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
patmo-20080225-qpb/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
patmo-20080225-qpb/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
patmo-20080225-qpb/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT

peope-20081228-eym/wav/a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE

peope-20081228-eym/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
peope-20081228-eym/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
peope-20081228-eym/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
peope-20081228-fnh/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
peope-20081228-fnh/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
peope-20081228-fnh/wav/b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
peope-20081228-fnh/wav/b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0019 HE SAID TO HIMSELF THIS IS BETTER THAN WHITEWASHING THE SUNSHINE STRUCK HOT ON HIS FUR
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0020 SOFT BREEZES CARESSED HIS HEATED BROW AND AFTER THE SECLUSION OF THE CELLARAGE HE HAD LIVED IN SO LONG

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0022 JUMPING OFF ALL HIS FOUR LEGS AT ONCE IN THE JOY OF LIVING AND THE DELIGHT OF SPRING
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0023 WITHOUT ITS CLEANING HE PURSUED HIS WAY ACROSS THE MEADOW TILL HE REACHED THE HEDGE ON THE FURTHER SIDE

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0036 AS TO SEE ALL THE OTHER FELLOWS BUSY WORKING HE THOUGHT HIS HAPPINESS WAS COMPLETE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0037 WHEN AS HE MEANDERED AIMLESSLY ALONG SUDDENLY HE STOOD BY THE EDGE OF A FULL FED RIVER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0038 NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD HE SEEN A RIVER BEFORE THIS SLEEK SINUOUS FULL BODIED ANIMAL
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0039 CHASING AND CHUCKLING GRIPPING THINGS WITH A GURGLE

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0044 BY THE SIDE OF A MAN WHO HOLDS ONE SPELL BOUND BY EXCITING STORIES
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0045 AND WHEN TIRED AT LAST HE SAT ON THE BANK WHILE THE RIVER STILL CHATTERED ON TO HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0046 A BABBLING PROCESSION OF THE BEST STORIES IN THE WORLD SENT FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0047 TO BE TOLD AT LAST TO THE INSATIABLE SEA AS HE SAT ON THE GRASS AND LOOKED ACROSS THE RIVER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0048 A DARK HOLE IN THE BANK OPPOSITE JUST ABOVE THE WATER'S EDGE CAUGHT HIS EYE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0049 AND DREAMILY HE FELL TO CONSIDERING WHAT A NICE SNUG DWELLING PLACE IT WOULD MAKE FOR AN ANIMAL WITH
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0050 FEW WANTS AND FOND OF A BIJOU RIVERSIDE RESIDENCE ABOVE FLOOD LEVEL AND REMOTE FROM NOISE AND DUST

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0053 UNLIKELY SITUATION AND IT WAS TOO GLITTERING AND SMALL FOR A GLOW WORM THEN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0054 AS HE LOOKED IT WINKED AT HIM AND SO DECLARED ITSELF TO BE AN EYE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0055 AND A SMALL FACE BEGAN GRADUALLY TO GROW UP ROUND IT LIKE A FRAME ROUND A PICTURE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0056 A BROWN LITTLE FACE WITH WHISKERS A GRAVE ROUND FACE

peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0181 I CAME UP THIS BACKWATER TO TRY AND GET A MOMENT'S PEACE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0182 AND THEN STUMBLE UPON YOU FELLOWS AT LEAST I BEG PARDON I DON'T EXACTLY MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THERE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0183 WAS A RUSTLE BEHIND THEM PROCEEDING FROM A HEDGE WHEREIN LAST YEAR'S LEAVES STILL CLUNG THICK
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0184 AND A STRIPY HEAD WITH HIGH SHOULDERS BEHIND IT PEERED FORTH ON THEM COME ON OLD BADGER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0185 SHOUTED THE RAT THE BADGER TROTTED FORWARD A PACE OR TWO THEN GRUNTED HUM COMPANY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0186 AND TURNED HIS BACK AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THAT'S JUST THE SORT OF FELLOW HE IS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0187 OBSERVED THE DISAPPOINTED RAT SIMPLY HATES SOCIETY NOW WE SHAN'T SEE ANY MORE OF HIM TODAY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0188 WELL TELL US WHO'S OUT ON THE RIVER TOAD'S OUT FOR ONE REPLIED THE OTTER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0189 IN HIS BRAND NEW WAGER BOAT NEW TOGS NEW EVERYTHING THE TWO ANIMALS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0190 ONCE IT WAS NOTHING BUT SAILING SAID THE RAT THEN HE TIRED OF THAT AND TOOK TO PUNTING
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0191 NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HIM BUT TO PUNT ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY AND
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0192 A NICE MESS HE MADE OF IT LAST YEAR IT WAS HOUSE BOATING
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0193 AND WE ALL HAD TO GO AND STAY WITH HIM IN HIS HOUSE BOAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0194 AND PRETEND WE LIKED IT HE WAS GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN A HOUSE BOAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0195 IT'S ALL THE SAME WHATEVER HE TAKES UP HE GETS TIRED OF IT AND STARTS ON SOMETHING FRESH
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0196 SUCH A GOOD FELLOW TOO REMARKED THE OTTER REFLECTIVELY BUT NO STABILITY ESPECIALLY IN A BOAT FROM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0197 WHERE THEY SAT THEY COULD GET A GLIMPSE OF THE MAIN STREAM ACROSS THE ISLAND THAT SEPARATED THEM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0198 AND JUST THEN A WAGER BOAT FLASHED INTO VIEW THE ROWER A SHORT STOUT FIGURE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0199 SPLASHING BADLY AND ROLLING A GOOD DEAL BUT WORKING HIS HARDEST THE RAT STOOD UP AND HAILED HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0200 BUT TOAD FOR IT WAS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SETTLED STERNLY TO HIS WORK
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0201 HE'LL BE OUT OF THE BOAT IN A MINUTE IF HE ROLLS LIKE THAT SAID THE RAT SITTING DOWN AGAIN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0202 OF COURSE HE WILL CHUCKLED THE OTTER DID I EVER TELL YOU THAT GOOD STORY ABOUT TOAD AND THE LOCK KEEPER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0203 IT HAPPENED THIS WAY TOAD AN ERRANT MAY FLY SWERVED UNSTEADILY ATHWART THE CURRENT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0204 IN THE INTOXICATED FASHION AFFECTED BY YOUNG BLOODS OF MAY FLIES SEEING LIFE A SWIRL OF WATER AND A CLOOP
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0205 AND THE MAY FLY WAS VISIBLE NO MORE NEITHER WAS THE OTTER THE MOLE LOOKED DOWN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0206 THE VOICE WAS STILL IN HIS EARS BUT THE TURF WHEREON HE HAD SPRAWLED
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0207 WAS CLEARLY VACANT NOT AN OTTER TO BE SEEN AS FAR AS THE DISTANT HORIZON
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0208 BUT AGAIN THERE WAS A STREAK OF BUBBLES ON THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER THE RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0209 HUMMED A TUNE AND THE MOLE RECOLLECTED THAT ANIMAL ETIQUETTE FORBADE ANY SORT OF COMMENT ON THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF ONE'S FRIENDS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0210 AT ANY MOMENT FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON WHATEVER WELL WELL SAID THE RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0211 I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING I WONDER WHICH OF US HAD BETTER PACK THE LUNCHEON BASKET
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0212 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS IF HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY EAGER FOR THE TREAT O
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0213 PLEASE LET ME SAID THE MOLE SO OF COURSE THE RAT LET HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0214 PACKING THE BASKET WAS NOT QUITE SUCH PLEASANT WORK AS UNPACKING THE BASKET IT NEVER IS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0215 BUT THE MOLE WAS BENT ON ENJOYING EVERYTHING AND ALTHOUGH
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0216 JUST WHEN HE HAD GOT THE BASKET PACKED AND STRAPPED UP TIGHTLY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0217 HE SAW A PLATE STARING UP AT HIM FROM THE GRASS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0218 AND WHEN THE JOB HAD BEEN DONE AGAIN THE RAT POINTED OUT A FORK WHICH
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0219 ANYBODY OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN AND LAST OF ALL BEHOLD THE MUSTARD POT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0220 WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING ON WITHOUT KNOWING IT STILL SOMEHOW THE THING GOT FINISHED AT LAST WITHOUT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0221 MUCH LOSS OF TEMPER THE AFTERNOON SUN WAS GETTING LOW AS THE RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0222 SCULLED GENTLY HOMEWARDS IN A DREAMY MOOD MURMURING POETRY THINGS OVER TO HIMSELF
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0223 AND NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO MOLE BUT THE MOLE WAS VERY FULL OF LUNCH AND SELF SATISFACTION
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0224 AND PRIDE AND ALREADY QUITE AT HOME IN A BOAT SO HE THOUGHT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0225 AND WAS GETTING A BIT RESTLESS BESIDES AND PRESENTLY HE SAID RATTY PLEASE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0226 I WANT TO ROW NOW THE RAT SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0227 NOT YET MY YOUNG FRIEND HE SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE HAD A FEW LESSONS IT'S NOT SO EASY AS IT LOOKS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0228 THE MOLE WAS QUIET FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT HE BEGAN TO FEEL
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0229 MORE AND MORE JEALOUS OF RAT SCULLING SO STRONGLY AND SO EASILY ALONG
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0230 AND HIS PRIDE BEGAN TO WHISPER THAT HE COULD DO IT EVERY BIT AS WELL
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0231 HE JUMPED UP AND SEIZED THE SCULLS SO SUDDENLY THAT THE RAT WHO WAS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0232 GAZING OUT OVER THE WATER AND SAYING MORE POETRY THINGS TO HIMSELF
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0233 WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND FELL BACKWARDS OFF HIS SEAT WITH HIS LEGS IN THE AIR FOR THE SECOND TIME
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0234 WHILE THE TRIUMPHANT MOLE TOOK HIS PLACE AND GRABBED THE SCULLS WITH ENTIRE CONFIDENCE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0235 STOP IT YOU SILLY ASS CRIED THE RAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU'LL HAVE US OVER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0236 THE MOLE FLUNG HIS SCULLS BACK WITH A FLOURISH AND MADE A GREAT DIG AT THE WATER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0237 HE MISSED THE SURFACE ALTOGETHER HIS LEGS FLEW UP ABOVE HIS HEAD
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0238 AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LYING ON THE TOP OF THE PROSTRATE RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0239 GREATLY ALARMED HE MADE A GRAB AT THE SIDE OF THE BOAT AND THE NEXT MOMENT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0240 SPLOOSH OVER WENT THE BOAT AND HE FOUND HIMSELF STRUGGLING IN THE RIVER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0241 O MY HOW COLD THE WATER WAS AND O HOW VERY WET IT FELT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0242 HOW IT SANG IN HIS EARS AS HE WENT DOWN DOWN DOWN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0243 HOW BRIGHT AND WELCOME THE SUN LOOKED AS HE ROSE TO THE SURFACE COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0244 HOW BLACK WAS HIS DESPAIR WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING AGAIN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0245 THEN A FIRM PAW GRIPPED HIM BY THE BACK OF HIS NECK IT WAS THE RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0246 AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY LAUGHING THE MOLE COULD FEEL HIM LAUGHING
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0247 RIGHT DOWN HIS ARM AND THROUGH HIS PAW AND SO INTO HIS THE MOLE'S NECK
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0248 THE RAT GOT HOLD OF A SCULL AND SHOVED IT UNDER THE MOLE'S ARM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0249 THEN HE DID THE SAME BY THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0250 AND SWIMMING BEHIND PROPELLED THE HELPLESS ANIMAL TO SHORE HAULED HIM OUT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0251 AND SET HIM DOWN ON THE BANK A SQUASHY PULPY LUMP OF MISERY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0252 WHEN THE RAT HAD RUBBED HIM DOWN A BIT AND WRUNG SOME OF THE WET OUT OF HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0253 HE SAID NOW THEN OLD FELLOW TROT UP AND DOWN THE TOWING PATH AS HARD AS YOU CAN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0254 TILL YOU'RE WARM AND DRY AGAIN WHILE I DIVE FOR THE LUNCHEON BASKET SO THE DISMAL MOLE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0255 WET WITHOUT AND ASHAMED WITHIN TROTTED ABOUT TILL HE WAS FAIRLY DRY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0256 WHILE THE RAT PLUNGED INTO THE WATER AGAIN RECOVERED THE BOAT RIGHTED HER AND MADE HER FAST
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0257 FETCHED HIS FLOATING PROPERTY TO SHORE BY DEGREES AND FINALLY DIVED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE LUNCHEON BASKET
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0258 AND STRUGGLED TO LAND WITH IT WHEN ALL WAS READY FOR A START ONCE MORE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0259 THE MOLE LIMP AND DEJECTED TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE STERN OF THE BOAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0260 AND AS THEY SET OFF HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE BROKEN WITH EMOTION
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0261 RATTY MY GENEROUS FRIEND I AM VERY SORRY INDEED FOR MY FOOLISH AND UNGRATEFUL CONDUCT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0262 MY HEART QUITE FAILS ME WHEN I THINK HOW I MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT BEAUTIFUL LUNCHEON BASKET
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0263 INDEED I HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE ASS AND I KNOW IT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0264 WILL YOU OVERLOOK IT THIS ONCE AND FORGIVE ME AND LET THINGS GO ON AS BEFORE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0265 THAT'S ALL RIGHT BLESS YOU RESPONDED THE RAT CHEERILY WHAT'S A LITTLE WET TO A WATER RAT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0266 I'M MORE IN THE WATER THAN OUT OF IT MOST DAYS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0267 DON'T YOU THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT AND LOOK HERE I REALLY THINK YOU HAD BETTER COME AND STOP WITH ME FOR A LITTLE TIME
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0268 IT'S VERY PLAIN AND ROUGH YOU KNOW NOT LIKE TOAD'S HOUSE AT ALL
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0269 BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET STILL I CAN MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0270 AND I'LL TEACH YOU TO ROW AND TO SWIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0271 AND YOU'LL SOON BE AS HANDY ON THE WATER AS ANY OF US THE MOLE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0272 WAS SO TOUCHED BY HIS KIND MANNER OF SPEAKING THAT HE COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER HIM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0273 AND HE HAD TO BRUSH AWAY A TEAR OR TWO WITH THE BACK OF HIS PAW
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0274 BUT THE RAT KINDLY LOOKED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AND PRESENTLY THE MOLE'S SPIRITS REVIVED AGAIN
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0275 AND HE WAS EVEN ABLE TO GIVE SOME STRAIGHT BACK TALK TO A COUPLE OF MOORHENS WHO WERE SNIGGERING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HIS BEDRAGGLED APPEARANCE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0276 WHEN THEY GOT HOME THE RAT MADE A BRIGHT FIRE IN THE PARLOUR
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0277 AND PLANTED THE MOLE IN AN ARM CHAIR IN FRONT OF IT
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0278 HAVING FETCHED DOWN A DRESSING GOWN AND SLIPPERS FOR HIM AND TOLD HIM RIVER STORIES TILL SUPPER TIME
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0279 VERY THRILLING STORIES THEY WERE TOO TO AN EARTH DWELLING ANIMAL LIKE MOLE
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0280 STORIES ABOUT WEIRS AND SUDDEN FLOODS AND LEAPING PIKE AND STEAMERS THAT FLUNG HARD BOTTLES
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0281 AT LEAST BOTTLES WERE CERTAINLY FLUNG AND FROM STEAMERS SO PRESUMABLY BY THEM AND ABOUT HERONS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0282 AND HOW PARTICULAR THEY WERE WHOM THEY SPOKE TO AND ABOUT ADVENTURES DOWN DRAINS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0283 AND NIGHT FISHINGS WITH OTTER OR EXCURSIONS FAR A FIELD WITH BADGER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0284 SUPPER WAS A MOST CHEERFUL MEAL BUT VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLY SLEEPY MOLE HAD TO BE ESCORTED UPSTAIRS BY HIS CONSIDERATE HOST
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0285 TO THE BEST BEDROOM WHERE HE SOON LAID HIS HEAD ON HIS PILLOW
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0286 IN GREAT PEACE AND CONTENTMENT KNOWING THAT HIS NEW FOUND FRIEND THE RIVER
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0287 WAS LAPPING THE SILL OF HIS WINDOW THIS DAY
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0288 WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF MANY SIMILAR ONES FOR THE EMANCIPATED MOLE EACH OF THEM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0289 LONGER AND FULL OF INTEREST AS THE RIPENING SUMMER MOVED ONWARD HE LEARNT TO SWIM AND TO ROW
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0290 AND ENTERED INTO THE JOY OF RUNNING WATER AND WITH HIS EAR TO THE REED STEMS
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0291 HE CAUGHT AT INTERVALS SOMETHING OF WHAT THE WIND WENT WHISPERING SO CONSTANTLY AMONG THEM
peterwhy-20080503-win/wav/win0292 THE END OF CHAPTER ONE OF THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS BY KENNETH GRAHAME
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY

Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
Peyrine-20091111-ptc/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING

pfmm-20080526-oza/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
pfmm-20080526-oza/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
pfmm-20080526-oza/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON

PheonixK-20080824-pck/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
PheonixK-20080824-vws/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO

PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
PheonixK-20080824-wte/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE

phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
phowardcom-20090824-blg/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
phr0663r-20090922-jqj/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
PJ-20091206-zfv/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
pkkikibig-20100105-xib/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
pmg-20090902-gqi/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
pmg-20090902-ogw/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
pmg-20090902-sgg/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
PoHandle-20091222-hxy/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
PoHandle-20091222-klf/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
PoHandle-20091222-mex/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
PoHandle-20091222-pbi/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
PoHandle-20091222-wby/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
polerizer-20091226-cxd/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
polerizer-20091226-der/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
polerizer-20091226-flf/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
polerizer-20091226-iie/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
polerizer-20091226-noj/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
polerizer-20091226-nws/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
polerizer-20091226-ooi/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
polerizer-20091226-rel/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
polerizer-20091226-vdf/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
polerizer-20091226-wre/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
polerizer-20091226-wre/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
polerizer-20091226-wre/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
polerizer-20091226-wre/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
polerizer-20091231-nfw/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST

polerizer-20091231-oon/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
polerizer-20091231-upo/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL

poumtatalia-20071105-kol/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
poumtatalia-20071105-kol/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
poumtatalia-20071105-kol/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
poumtatalia-20071105-kol/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
poumtatalia-20071105-kol/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
proffles-20080627-nzp/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
proffles-20080627-pgw/wav/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0052 GONE FROM HER FACE
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
proffles-20080627-upk/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
proffles-20080627-vjc/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD

pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
pszacherski-20081021-ymh/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
pumpkinslayer-20071020-ejq/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
pumpkinslayer-20071020-fct/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
pumpkinslayer-20071020-rrg/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-11 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-12 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
pumpkinslayer-20071021-iku/wav/rb-13 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0450 MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0452 SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0453 FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
qway-20080924-yjx/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
qway-20080928-anj/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes10 AND AT LAST THE NORTH WIND GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes11 THEN THE SUN SHONE OUT WARMLY
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes12 AND IMMEDIATELY THE TRAVELER TOOK OFF HIS CLOAK
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes13 AND SO THE NORTH WIND WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes14 THAT THE SUN WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes15 END OF TEXT THIS RECORDING IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes1 DIALECT AND ACCENT COLLECTION VOLUME ONE
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes2 THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN ATTRIBUTED TO AESOP
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes3 READ FOR LIBRIVOX DOT ORG BY ZONIA IN A GERMAN ACCENT
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes4 THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN WERE DISPUTING WHICH WAS THE STRONGER
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes5 WHEN A TRAVELER CAME ALONG WRAPPED IN A WARM CLOAK
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes6 THEY AGREED THAT THE ONE WHO FIRST SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE TRAVELER TAKE HIS CLOAK OFF
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes7 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED STRONGER THAN THE OTHER
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes8 THEN THE NORTH WIND BLEW AS HARD AS HE COULD
Raeubertochter-20090911/wav/aes9 BUT THE MORE HE BLEW THE MORE CLOSELY DID THE TRAVELER FOLD HIS CLOAK AROUND HIM
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
raghuraman-20090512-enq/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-048 HE IS ALMOST FINISHED
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-049 SHE WANTS TO BE INVISIBLE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-050 HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT SHE SAYS TO HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-051 THERE IS LIKE A MILLION ROOMS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-052 HE FEELS COLD INSIDE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-053 IT IS LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-054 HOW MUCH WAS IT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-055 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-056 FROM NOW ON WE ARE FRIENDS

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-058 CAN I SPEAK TO HER FOR ONE SECOND
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-059 THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH THIS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-060 SHE REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-061 THAT PART SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-062 DOES SHE THINK THAT WAS EASY FOR HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-063 HE WANTS TO REGULATE HER THOUGHTS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-064 HE NEEDS TO TALK TO HER IN PRIVATE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-065 SHE HAS NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-066 THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY SHORT BREAK
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-067 THEY WON'T BE HONORING THAT TRADITION
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-068 A TICKLE IN HER THROAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-069 WHY ARE THEY HERE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-070 AND SHE CANNOT SAY NO
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-071 SHE SEES HIM AS THE FATHER OF HER CHILDREN
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-072 HE CAN'T DO THE CEREMONY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-073 THE BUSINESS OF LAW IS ABOUT GETTING CLIENTS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-074 HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-075 HE IS NOT EVEN SURE HE KNOWS WHAT THIS IS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-076 HE CALLED HER FROM HIS HOTEL ROOM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-077 WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-079 THEY WILL GO SEE HIM THIS AFTERNOON
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-080 CAN SHE IMAGINE THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-082 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-083 SHE IS ABOUT TO SETTLE DOWN FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-084 HE SAW HER WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-085 SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-086 SHE THANKED HIM FOR BEING SO CONCERNED ABOUT HER FEELINGS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-087 SHE IS HAVING A SMALL DINNER PARTY NEXT WEEK
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-088 IT WAS THAT OTHER WORD

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-090 AND THEY DON'T SAY A WORD
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-091 HE IS IN THE CAR WITH HER

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-093 SHE DIDN'T EVEN SMILE AT HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-094 WHAT IS WRONG IT IS THE NEW LOOK
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-095 SHE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO THE GAME

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-101 HE HAS GOT TO STOP IT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-102 STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-103 THAT MAN WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-104 WHY DOESN'T SHE CALL HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-105 SHE CAN PAY FOR THE NEXT ONE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-106 WHAT THE HELL IS IT

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-118 SHE IS GOING TO FACE IT BY HERSELF
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-119 HIS DAD IS AN EXPERT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-120 SHE IS STANDING AROUND

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-127 HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-128 THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-129 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-130 BUT SHE CAN'T BE WITH HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-131 HE NEVER TRIED TO HIDE WHO HE WAS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-132 HE IS JUST WORRIED ABOUT HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-133 HE SHOULD TALK TO HER

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-139 THE DOOR WON'T OPEN

ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-141 HE IS NOT SAYING TOMORROW
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-142 SHE IS SEEING THIS IN HER DREAMS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-143 WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-144 SHE IS SAFE WITH HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-145 SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-146 WHAT IS SHE WATCHING
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-147 HE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE HUNGRY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-148 THEY ARE GIVING HER A LITTLE SPACE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-149 THEY NEED TO GIVE HER TIME
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-150 IT IS TOO SOON
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-151 WHAT HE SAW WAS JUMBLED
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-152 WHY SHOULD HE GO TO AN OFFICE EVERY DAY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-153 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-154 SO HE JUST LEFT AFTER DINNER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-155 WHAT HAS SHE MISSED
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-156 SHE HAS SOMETHING FOR HER CLIENT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-157 WHY IS HE HERE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-158 SHE JUST WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-159 SHE HAD A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-160 WHAT IS THE MATTER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-161 SHE WILL GET HER COAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-162 SHE HASN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-163 SHE IS TOO GOOD FOR HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-164 I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-165 DID HE TELL YOU THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-166 WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-167 WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-168 HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-169 SHE THINKS THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-170 THAT IS NOT EVEN FUNNY
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-171 SHE DOUBTS ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-172 DID SHE COMPLAIN TO HER EMPLOYER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-173 CAN SHE GIVE THEM AN EXAMPLE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-174 SHE THINKS HE ASKED HER OUT ON A DATE
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-175 MAYBE THEY SHOULD WORK ON THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-176 IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-177 SHE IS NOT GOING TO TRICK HIM AGAIN
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-178 DON'T THEY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-179 IS HE DISTURBING HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7/wav/en7-180 SHE IS DRIVING IN HER CAR
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
ralfherzog-20070803/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
ralfherzog-20070810/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
ralfherzog-20070812/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-01 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-02 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD

ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-07 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-08 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME

ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12/wav/vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-01 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-02 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-03 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-04 NO-SIR-EE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-05 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-06 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13/wav/vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE

ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-28 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN

ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-37 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14/wav/vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-01 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-25 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-26 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-31 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-32 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15/wav/vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16/wav/vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17/wav/vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-16 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-17 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER

ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-19 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-20 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-21 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-22 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-23 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-24 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-25 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-26 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-27 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-28 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-29 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-30 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-31 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-32 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-33 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-34 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-35 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-36 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-37 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-38 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-39 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18/wav/vf18-40 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-14 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-35 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-36 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19/wav/vf19-37 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-06 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-07 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-08 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-09 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-10 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-11 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-12 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20/wav/vf20-13 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE

ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-17 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-18 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-19 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED

ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-32 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-33 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
ralfherzog-20070824_vf21/wav/vf21-34 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS

ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-10 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-11 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-12 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-13 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-14 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID

ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-17 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-18 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-19 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-20 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-21 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-22 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-23 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-24 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-25 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-26 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-27 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-28 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-29 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-30 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-31 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-32 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-33 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-34 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-35 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-36 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-37 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-38 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-39 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22/wav/vf22-40 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-01 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-02 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-03 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-04 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-05 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-06 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-07 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-08 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-09 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-10 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-11 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-12 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-13 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-14 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-15 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-16 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-17 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-18 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-19 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-20 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-21 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-22 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-23 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-24 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-25 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-26 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-27 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-28 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-29 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-30 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-31 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-32 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-33 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-34 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-35 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-36 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-37 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-38 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-39 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
ralfherzog-20070826_vf23/wav/vf23-40 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-01 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-02 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-03 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-04 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-05 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-06 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-07 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-08 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-09 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-10 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-11 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-12 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-13 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-14 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-15 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-16 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-17 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-18 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-19 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-20 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-21 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTZE RIVER
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-22 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-23 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-24 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-25 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-26 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-27 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-28 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-29 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-30 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-31 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-32 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-33 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-34 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-35 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-36 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-37 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-38 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-39 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24/wav/vf24-40 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-01 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-02 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-03 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-04 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-05 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-06 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-07 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-08 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-09 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-10 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-11 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-12 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-13 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-14 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-15 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-16 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-17 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI-HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-18 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-19 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-20 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-21 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-22 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-23 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-24 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-25 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-26 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-27 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-28 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-29 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-30 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-31 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-32 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-33 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-34 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-35 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-36 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-37 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-38 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-39 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25/wav/vf25-40 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-001 THIS IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-002 NOW ALL I NEED IS A LITTLE HELP HE IS VERY GOOD
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-003 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FIRST
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-004 WE HAVEN'T HAD A VACATION IN A WHILE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-005 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-006 I KNOW YOU ARE HERE WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-007 WE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-008 YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-009 SHE IS FASTER THAN SHE LOOKS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-010 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT FAST
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-011 HE IS AT HOME THIS IS WHAT I REALIZE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-012 SHE NEEDS YOU NO LONGER I NEED HER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-013 I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-014 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU IN PERSON
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-015 I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT GET ME OUT OF HERE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-016 DO YOU THINK HE FOUND HIM I WANTED TO DO THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-017 THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-018 ARE YOU HERE OR NOT GET RID OF HIM
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-019 THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-020 I HAD NO CHOICE THAT WAS JUST A JOKE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-021 I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE I AM NOT SLOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-022 I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU I CAN FIX THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-023 I AM GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-024 YOU HAVE TO BE QUIET NOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-025 YOU LEFT ME ALL ALONE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-026 I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO BREATHE AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-027 IT COULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-028 I DON'T REMEMBER WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-029 IT IS ASSUMED THAT THESE VALUES HAVE BEEN ORDERED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-030 THE LOWEST AND THE HIGHEST QUARTER OF VALUES HAVE BEEN REMOVED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-031 IT IS A SPECIFIED EXAMPLE OF A TRUNCATED MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-032 THE NUMBERS ARE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THEIR PRODUCT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-033 THOSE NUMBERS ARE DEFINED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-034 IN RELATION TO THE DISTANCE PER UNIT OF TIME
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-035 A LOT OF DISTRIBUTIONS ARE BEST DESCRIBED BY THEIR MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-036 THE MEAN IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MEDIAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-037 THOSE MEANS AREN'T OF MUCH USE IN STATISTICS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-038 MEANS ARE OFTEN USED IN ANALYSIS AND GEOMETRY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-039 THE MEAN DESCRIBES THE CENTRAL LOCATION OF THE DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-040 THE MEAN IS THE SUM OF OBSERVATIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-041 THAT HAS TO BE DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-042 NOT EVERY PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION HAS A DEFINED MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-043 THE ARITHMETIC MEAN IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE GEOMETRIC MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-044 THE CHECKSUM SHOULD BE ADDED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-045 THE OUTPUT WILL BE SAVED IN COMPRESSED FORMAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-046 THE SIGNAL WILL BE USING COEFFICIENT OF TEN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-047 THE VARIABLE SHOULD BE SET TO TRUE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-048 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CREATE CODED DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-049 THOSE ARE THE RELEVANT TOOLS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-050 WHAT IS THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT FILE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-051 THOSE ARE THE FIRST FEW LINES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-052 WE HAVE TO AVOID SEVERAL THOUSAND ARGUMENTS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-053 THEY HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-054 A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE IS USED TO CODE THE SPEECH DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-055 MULTIPLE PRONUNCIATIONS ARE POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-056 WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF THE VECTOR
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-057 THIS IS REALLY DISGUSTING WHERE ARE WE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-058 CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC I AM SURE ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-059 THE WHEEL IS ALREADY SPINNING LET HIM PLAY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-060 HE IS USING HIM TO DESTROY PEOPLE'S LIVES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-061 I WASN'T AWAY YOU NEEDED SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-062 YOU DON'T KNOW THE HELL I HAVE BEEN THROUGH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-063 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY EMBARRASSING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-064 THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-065 I WOULD KNOW I WAS RIGHT SHE IS GOING TO BE FINE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-066 I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER LET'S FIND OUT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-067 YOU ARE FEELING REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-068 WE HAVE TO GET A GOOD COVERAGE OF PHONEMES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-069 I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1/wav/en1-070 IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE THANK YOU

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-16 HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A STRANGER
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-17 HE WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-21 SHE IS HAPPY FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-22 THIS IS NO ENVIRONMENT FOR A CHILD
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-23 SO THERE IS NO CHANCE OF YOU GOING TO THAT PLACE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-24 IT IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-29 HE WANTS TO SAY TO HER WHAT HE WISHES HIS PARENTS HAD SAID TO HIM
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-30 IT WAS WORTH IT JUST TO SEE HIM
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-31 HE MIGHT NOT CALL
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-32 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-33 IT IS NOT EASY TO FORGET
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-34 THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-35 HE WAS TRYING TO BE HONEST
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-36 HER MOM GAVE IT TO HER IT IS HER GETAWAY CAR

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-39 HE HAS TO ADMIT IT SOUNDS KIND OF STRANGE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-40 I COULD BE WEARING A WIRE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-41 HE IS NOT PART OF THE FAMILY

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-56 DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND YOUR WAY HOME
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-57 HE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-58 THIS IS THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-59 HE WISHES HE COULD EXPLAIN BUT HE CAN'T
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-60 HE JUST HOPES SHE IS ALL RIGHT

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-63 WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-64 HE NEVER REALIZED HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO GET EVERYTHING
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-65 DIDN'T SHE TELL HIM SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SPLIT
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-66 SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IS HE DOING THIS
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-67 HE WILL CALL SECURITY
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-68 HE HAS GOT NO IDEA WHO HE IS DEALING WITH
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-69 HE HAS NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-70 HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE INTERRUPTION

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-77 THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROTECT HIM
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-78 IT HAS CHANGED HIS PERSONALITY
ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-79 HE WISHES SHE COULD HEAR HERSELF FOR JUST A MINUTE

ralfherzog-20070914-en5/wav/en5-95 THEY DON'T HAVE TO HUG OR ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-01 THAT IS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-02 WELCOME TO THE CLUB
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-03 HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE A CONNECTION
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-04 HE SEEMS PERFECT BUT HE IS NOT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-05 THE LIMIT OF THE POWER CAN BE ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-06 THEY ARE UNDEFINED FOR THE SAME REASON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-07 IT IS FAR LESS COMMON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-08 HE HAS A BUSINESS TO RUN
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-09 WHAT IS THEIR NEXT MOVE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-10 HE IS TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-11 IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT HER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-12 WHAT DOES HE THINK HE IS DOING
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-13 IT IS WHAT HE ALWAYS WANTED
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-14 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-15 THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CANNOT BE FRIENDS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-16 SHE KNOWS SHE WASN'T THE EASIEST PERSON TO LIVE WITH
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-17 SHE TOOK IT OUT ON HIM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-18 HE DOESN'T WANT TO APOLOGIZE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-19 SOMEBODY TELL HER WHAT IS GOING ON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-20 HE IS TOO YOUNG FOR EARLY RETIREMENT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-21 SHE OWES HIM AN APOLOGY
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-22 SHE JUST WANTED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DO A BAD JOB
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-23 THE FAMILY NEEDS HER THE COMPANY NEEDS HER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-24 HE IS SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-25 HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE SUPERVISED
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-26 WHAT IS HE DOING IN HERE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-27 HOW DID HE GET IN HERE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-28 HE IS NOT THE ONE SHE SHOULD BE TELLING THIS TO
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-29 SHE IS SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-30 THAT IS WHAT HE LIKES TO HEAR
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-31 SHE WILL SEE HIM IN CLASS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-32 HE CAN'T THINK OF THEM RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-33 HARD DRIVES ARE MOVING AT VERY HIGH SPEED
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-34 THEY HAVE LESS CAPACITY AND TEND TO BE SLOWER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-35 THE MAGNETIC REGION FORMS THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-36 IT IS COMPOSED OF MAGNETIC GRAINS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-37 IT ENCODES A SINGLE BINARY UNIT OF INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-38 THE ELECTROMAGNET PRODUCES A MAGNETIC FIELD
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-39 THE DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-40 THE HEAD MOVES TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE DISK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-41 THE HEAD MOVES QUICKLY OVER THE SURFACE OF THE DISK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-42 WE NEED ACCESS TO LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-43 HE WENT TO CHURCH
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-44 THIS WAS A REALLY GREAT GAG
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-45 THE SEALED UNIT CONTAINS FIXED MEDIA
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-46 EARLY DRIVES HAD REMOVABLE MEDIA
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-47 A HARD DISK DRIVE IS A STORAGE DEVICE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-48 IT STORES DIGITALLY ENCODED DATA
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-49 THE DEVICE IS DISTINCT FROM ITS MEDIUM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-50 THIS SHOWS AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-51 THEY ARE PLANNING TO REPLACE THE CURRENT PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-52 IT HAS THE SECOND LARGEST HYDROPOWER PRODUCTION IN THE WORLD
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-53 A HEAD CRASH CAN BE INITIATED BY A PARTICLE OF DIRT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-54 IT IS HIS JOB TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-55 THEY ARE GOING TO GET THIS GUY
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-56 AND SHE HAS DONE IT BEFORE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-57 HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS HE GOT A BAD FEELING
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-58 HE WANTED TO SEE IF IT WAS TRUE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-59 WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT STUFF
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-60 SHE PROBABLY THINKS THAT HE IS INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-61 IT WILL ALL LOOK DIFFERENT IN THE MORNING
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-62 HE WANTS HIM TO MEET ONE OF HIS BEST STUDENTS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-63 SHE HAS DONE SOME GREAT WORK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-64 IT MUST HAVE COST A FORTUNE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-65 HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO IN THERE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-66 HOW MUCH DID HE GET
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-67 THEY HAVE TO HEAR IT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-68 THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT CITIES
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-69 THEY ASK THEM ABOUT POLITICS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-70 HE SUGGESTS AND THEY GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-71 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-72 WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-73 ALL HIS FRIENDS ABANDONED HIM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-74 HE IS GOING TO SAY THIS ONCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-75 HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE WOULD DO FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-76 HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE ALL ANSWERED SOON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-77 HE IS YELLING AT HER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-78 SHE THINKS THAT IS THE SORT OF THING SHE REMEMBERS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-79 HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE COMPETITION
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-80 SHE JUST NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-81 THERE IS A LOT SHE NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-82 DOES HE KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT PAYBACK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-83 HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-84 DOES SHE REMEMBER EVERYTHING THEY WENT OVER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-85 HE IS FASTER ON HIS OWN
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-86 THEY WILL FIND AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20070917-en6/wav/en6-87 SHE HAS BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF HIM
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-001 SHE KNOWS THAT HE IS NOT REALLY THERE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-002 WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-003 THEY NEED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-004 DO THEY HAVE ANY OTHER NEW PEOPLE TODAY
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-005 THAT IS ALL HE HAS TO SAY
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-006 WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT DOES SHE THINK
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-007 DON'T GET ME WRONG

ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-010 BUT SHE IS GLAD THEY DID IT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-011 BUT IT WAS JUST A DREAM
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-012 WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO SAY
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-013 THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-014 SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF HAVING IT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-015 WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-016 HE IS A LITTLE JAMMED RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-017 WHY IS SHE HERE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-018 SHE THINKS HE WORKED THERE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-019 SHE TOOK THE DRUG DIDN'T SHE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-020 SHE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT EITHER
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-021 SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WALKING HOME
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-022 SHE IS LESS AFRAID OF BEING ALONE

ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-024 SHE TRIED TO BE SWEET
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-025 SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-026 IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-027 IT SAVED ME A LOT OF TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-028 HE SHOULDN'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-029 HE IS NOT GOING TO THE NEXT MEETING

ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-038 YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU DON'T RESPECT THEM
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-039 THIS IS USED IN THE CREATION OF TITLES
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-040 IT HAS BEEN THE ULTIMATE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-041 THE COMPANY PRODUCES THE EQUIPMENT
ralfherzog-20070923-en8/wav/en8-042 WE CAN SET UP THE HARDWARE IN THE CONTROL ROOM

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-036 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE SHE IS UNDER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-037 HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-038 HOW COULD SHE DO THIS

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-041 ARE THEY REALLY IN TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-042 HE WAS JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-044 SHE IS IN BIG TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-045 TAKE A COUPLE OF SECONDS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-046 SHE NEEDS TIME TO THINK

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-050 SHE CAN'T PROMISE HIM ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-051 HE IS MAKING A MISTAKE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-052 THAT BOUGHT THEM TIME AND THEY SHOULD USE IT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-053 WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM THEM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-054 THEY SHOULD START THE OTHER LINE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-055 THEY NEED MEDICAL HELP
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-056 SHE IS NOT SAYING ANYTHING UNTIL SHE GETS IMMUNITY
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-057 WHERE DID SHE GET THAT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-058 HE WON'T FIGHT HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-059 THE DIAGRAM SHOWS A PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-060 THE CONTROL SYSTEM DECODES THE INSTRUCTIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-061 THIS DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF THE CPU
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-062 THE COMPUTER CHANGED THE ORDER OF SOME INSTRUCTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-063 THEY AREN'T COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE COMPONENTS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-064 IT IS KNOWN AS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-065 PROGRAMS MAKE COMPUTERS EXTREMELY VERSATILE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-066 YOU CAN DISTINGUISH CALCULATORS FROM COMPUTERS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-067 THEY ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE AND STORE LISTS OF INSTRUCTIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-068 THEY MAY BE FOUND IN DIGITAL CAMERAS AND INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-069 COMPUTERS ARE OFTEN USED TO CONTROL SEVERAL DEVICES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-070 THOSE ARE SMALL AND SIMPLE DEVICES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-071 THE EMBEDDED COMPUTER IS THE MOST COMMON FORM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-072 PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE THE ICONS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-073 THEY ARE OCCUPYING A FRACTION OF THE SPACE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-074 THEY ARE BASED ON TINY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-075 THOSE COMPUTERS HAD THE SIZE OF A LARGE ROOM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-076 A COMPUTER MANIPULATES DATA
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-077 THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMON DEFINITIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-078 THERE IS SOME CONFUSION WITH THIS CONCEPT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-079 THERE IS A RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-080 SHE ISN'T SURE SHE BELIEVES HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-081 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-082 SHE WANTED TO SEE HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-083 HE NEEDS TO TALK TO HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-084 WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-085 THIS IS KIND OF A GOOD TIME
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-086 WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-087 SHE SAID IT WAS URGENT

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-093 SHE JUST WANTS THEM TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-094 BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-095 SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO KEEP IT FROM HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-096 SHE WAS DISTANT AND PREOCCUPIED
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-097 SHE IS SURE IT WAS A MISSION
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-098 TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-099 IT IS A LITTLE BETTER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-100 HE IS GOING TO BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-101 SHE DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME DID SHE

ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-103 PATCH HIM THROUGH TO HER OFFICE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-104 IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT COUPLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-105 SHE HAS TO TAKE IT SEND IT TO HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-106 HE IS SURPRISED SHE WAITED THIS LONG
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-107 THINGS CONTINUE TO GO WRONG
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-108 THIS WOULD BE INTOLERABLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-109 THEY HAD SOME BAD LUCK THAT IS ALL
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-110 SHE HELPS HIM NAVIGATE THROUGH TRAFFIC
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-111 THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE IN A FEW MINUTES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-112 HE FOUND SOMETHING ON HER COMPUTER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-113 HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-114 THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-115 THEY HAVE LOCATED HIS CAR
ralfherzog-20070924-en9/wav/en9-116 THEY DIDN'T GET IT

ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-034 THE COMPUTER SWITCH IS RAPIDLY BETWEEN EACH PROGRAM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-035 SEVERAL PROGRAMS ARE RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-036 ONE PROGRAM IS STORED IN THE MAIN MEMORY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-037 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-038 HE WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS WORKING WITH HER
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-039 SHE WAS SURPRISED YOU CALLED LAST NIGHT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-040 THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-041 WOULD YOU SEND ME A COPY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-042 AND HE NEEDS TO DO IT NOW

ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-048 IT IS NOT HIS DECISION TO MAKE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-049 THEY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-050 SHE IS A LITTLE CONFUSED
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-051 DID HE EXPLAIN WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-052 SHE WILL BE OUT HERE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-053 JUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE TIME
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-054 THEY ARE DOING MORE THAN DEBRIEFING HIM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-055 THE AMBULANCE WILL TAKE HER TO THE CLINIC
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-056 IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GO BACK
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-057 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-058 HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT CHOICE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-059 AND HE THINKS IT IS JUST GETTING STARTED
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-060 I AM TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN REGIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-061 HOW MUCH LONGER DO THEY HAVE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-062 WHY IS SHE SHUTTING HIM OUT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-063 THEY NEED TO START THE DEBRIEF
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-064 SHE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND HIM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-065 SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE PASSWORD
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-066 WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE DOESN'T SHOW UP
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-067 SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-068 SHE IS GOING TO BE FINE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-069 POLITICAL MAPS DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT COUNTRIES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-070 WHAT ARE ITS PHYSICAL FEATURES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-071 YOU CAN GET A BASIC SENSE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-072 PHYSICAL MAPS ILLUSTRATE LANDFORMS LIKE LAKES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-073 IT PRESENTS INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-074 MAPS CAN DESCRIBE NEARLY ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-075 THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT CONDUCTING ELECTRICITY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-076 METALS CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE EARTH
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-077 SILVER IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THESE METALS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-078 THEY PLAY A MAJOR ROLE AS A STORE OF VALUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-079 THEY ARE NOW REGARDED AS INVESTMENT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-080 PRECIOUS METALS WERE IMPORTANT AS CURRENCY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-081 THEY HAVE A HIGH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-082 PRECIOUS METALS ARE LESS REACTIVE THAN OTHER ELEMENTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-083 IT HAS TO BE MUCH SIMPLER
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-084 THEY HAVE FEWER CHOICES IN COLOR
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-085 THEY ARE DEVELOPING A MAP SPECIFICALLY FOR THE INTERNET
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-086 THOSE MAPS ARE INTENDED FOR ONLINE VIEWING
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-087 THE COORDINATE SYSTEM HELPS PEOPLE FIND SPECIFIC LOCATIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-088 THE MAP INCLUDES SOME KIND OF COORDINATE SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-089 THIS IS A CONVENTIONAL MAP OF THE WORLD
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-090 THE OPERATION PRODUCES A VALUE OF FALSE IF AND ONLY IF BOTH OF ITS OPERANDS ARE TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-091 IT PRODUCES A VALUE OF TRUE IF ONE BUT NOT BOTH OF ITS OPERANDS IS TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-092 THE OPERATION PRODUCES A DIFFERENT VALUE IF BOTH OPERANDS ARE FALSE OR BOTH OPERANDS ARE TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-093 THAT PRODUCES A VALUE OF FALSE IF THE FIRST OPERAND IS TRUE AND THE SECOND OPERAND IS FALSE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-094 IT PRODUCES A SPECIFIC VALUE IF BOTH OF ITS OPERANDS ARE FALSE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-095 LOGICAL DISJUNCTION IS AN OPERATION ON THE VALUES OF TWO PROPOSITIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-096 IF BOTH VALUES ARE TRUE THEN THE CONJUNCTION IS TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-097 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOGICAL NEGATION AND LOGICAL CONJUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-098 IT PRODUCES A VALUE OF TRUE IF BOTH OF ITS OPERANDS ARE TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-099 LOGICAL CONJUNCTION IS AN OPERATION ON TWO PROPOSITIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-100 THE TRUTH TABLE MAY BE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-101 IF ITS OPERAND IS FALSE IT PRODUCES A VALUE OF TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-102 IT PRODUCES A VALUE OF FALSE IF ITS OPERAND IS TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-103 LOGICAL NEGATION IS AN OPERATION ON THE VALUE OF A PROPOSITION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-104 ONLY TWO LOGICAL VALUES ARE POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-105 TRUTH TABLES FOR CLASSICAL LOGIC ARE LIMITED SPECIFIC LOGICAL SYSTEMS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-106 THIS PROPOSITIONAL VARIABLE IS A PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-107 A PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION IS A PROPOSITIONAL CONSTANT OR A PROPOSITIONAL FUNCTION TERM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-108 IT WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY A POINT THAT IS NOT IN THE UNION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-109 THEY CAN COMPUTE THE VALUES OF PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-110 ALL LEGITIMATE INPUT VALUES ARE LOGICALLY VALID
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-111 THE PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION IS TRUE FOR ALL INPUT VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-112 FOR THOSE VALUES ARE TAKEN BY THEIR LOGICAL VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-113 WHAT ARE THEIR FUNCTIONAL ARGUMENTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-114 THE TRUTH TABLE IS USED TO COMPUTE THE FUNCTIONAL VALUES OF LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-115 THE SPECIFIC TRUTH TABLE IS AS FOLLOWS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-116 THE VALUE IS TRUE IF AND ONLY IF BOTH OF THEM ARE TRUE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-117 THEY HAVE THE VALUES OF TWO PROPOSITIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-118 IT IS AN OPERATION ON TWO LOGICAL VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-119 THIS CONDENSED NOTATION IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-120 THE COLUMNS ARE THE SECOND OPERAND
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-121 THOSE DIAGRAMS PROVIDE A WAY OF VISUALIZING TRUTH TABLES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-122 THIS DEMONSTRATES THE FACT THAT THIS IS LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-123 THE FIRST AND SECOND EXPRESSIONS ARE LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-124 THE NEGATION OF DISJUNCTION IS TABULATED AS FOLLOWS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-125 THESE DIAGRAMS SHOW ALL OF THE POSSIBLE LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SETS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-126 THIS BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS IS KNOWN AS SET THEORY
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-127 THOSE DIAGRAMS ARE ILLUSTRATIONS USED IN THE BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-128 SO THE RESULT IS SEVEN POSSIBLE OUTPUTS OF THOSE VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-129 THEY CAN HAVE ONE OF TWO VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-130 IN AN ADDITION OPERATION YOU NEED SEVERAL OPERANDS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-131 THE SIZE OF THE TRUTH TABLE CAN INCREASE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-132 IT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR VERY SIMPLE OUTPUTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-133 IT SPECIFIES THE FUNCTION OF INPUTS TO OUTPUT VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-134 THIS TABLE DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE OPERATIONS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT OPERATION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-135 THE FIRST VALUE PAIR EQUALS THE SECOND VALUE PAIR
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-136 YOU MAY REPRESENT A BINARY OPERATION WITH A TRUTH TABLE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-137 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE LOGIC GATES OR CODE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-138 THEY CAN BE USED TO REDUCE BASIC OPERATIONS TO SIMPLE CORRELATIONS OF INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-139 OTHER REPRESENTATIONS ARE BINARY DECISION DIAGRAMS AND TEXT EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-140 THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR FUNCTIONS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF INPUTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-141 TRUTH TABLES ARE A SIMPLE WAY TO ENCODE FUNCTIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-142 THE OUTPUT VALUE CAN BE OBTAINED BY CALCULATING
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-143 THEY CAN BE EFFICIENTLY ENCODED AS INTEGER VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-144 THEY ARE USED TO SPECIFY THE FUNCTIONALITY OF HARDWARE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-145 IT IS ABLE TO COMPUTE THE EXPRESSIONS IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-146 THAT IS REFERRED TO AS A DECISION PROCEDURE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-147 IT IS AN ARTIFICIAL HOLE IN THE GROUND
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-148 BOTH SETS MAY HAVE SOME ELEMENTS IN COMMON
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-149 THE CIRCLE DOES NOT OVERLAP WITH THE ORANGE ONE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10/wav/en10-150 THIS PART DOES NOT OVERLAP WITH THE BLUE CIRCLE
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-001 HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-002 WHEN DOES HIS SUFFER ENDING
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-003 SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-004 IS SHE HOLDING OUT ON HER
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-005 THAT IS A MISTAKE
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-006 THEY MAY NEED HIM AS A BARGAINING CHIP
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-007 THEY HAVE TO ASSUME THE WORST
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-008 SHE JUST WANTED TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRES HIM
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-009 THAT IS A GOOD IDEA
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-010 HE AND HIS FAMILY MUST BE SO HAPPY
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-011 SHE IS GLAD HE LIKES IT
ralfherzog-20071007-en11/wav/en11-012 SHE IS JUST GOING THROUGH IT ONE LAST TIME

ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-091 THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO BRING JUSTICE TO THE STREETS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-092 THE SERIES IS ABOUT AN EXPERIMENTAL DIVISION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-093 THIS SEASON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-094 THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAVEFORM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-095 THAT WAS HIS BEST SUBJECT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-096 THE SUBJECT WAS OBSERVED LEAVING THE SCENE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-097 ALL FINAL ENTRIES WILL BE APPROVED BY THE EDITOR OF THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-098 YOU CAN CORRECT WORDS IN THE DICTIONARY

ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-100 THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SUITABILITY FOR ANY SPECIFIC PURPOSE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-101 THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-102 THEY HAVE VERIFIED THE TRANSCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-103 THE TRANSCRIPTION IS BASED ON ONLY ONE SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-104 SEVERAL SOURCES WERE PREPROCESSED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-105 THEY WILL CONSIDER THEM FOR AN UPCOMING VERSION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-106 THOSE WORDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-107 THEY GENERATED THIS DICTIONARY USING SEVERAL INDEPENDENT SOURCES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-108 THE PHONE SET CONTAINS THIRTY NINE PHONES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-109 THEY USE THESE DICTIONARIES IN THEIR SYSTEMS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-110 IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL COMMAND
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-111 TAKE THE TIME TO SUBMIT SOME SPEECH TO THE PROJECT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-112 THEY NEED MUCH MORE TRANSCRIBED SPEECH AUDIO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-113 THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-114 THE QUALITY OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IS FAIR
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-115 FOR INFORMATION ON THE GRAMMAR SYNTAX SEE THE ENCLOSED NOTES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-116 CHANGE THE DIRECTORY TO THE FOLDER WHERE YOU EXTRACT THE FILE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-117 SIMPLY EXTRACT THE FILE TO A DIRECTORY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-118 THE FILE CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET THE PROGRAM WORKING
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-119 THE PROGRAM IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-120 IT CONTAINS MUCH DATA BUT NOT MUCH INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-121 THIS CAN BE USED IN THE AREA OF IMAGE PROCESSING
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-122 THIS PROGRAM IS FREE SOFTWARE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-123 YOU CAN REDISTRIBUTE IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-124 THEY CAN DRAW A PICTURE OF IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-125 THEY CAN FIND A SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-126 THERE IS NO WAY OF EXTENDING IT FURTHER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-127 THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF THAT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-128 THERE IS ANOTHER SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-129 A TYPICAL SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-130 THEY SHOULD SOLVE THIS BY SEPARATING VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-131 IN OTHER WORDS DON'T WRITE IT LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-132 THE SLOPE ELEMENTS LOOK LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-133 THIS IS A LINE THROUGH THE ORIGIN
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-134 HE WANTS TO PUT THAT UP IN ORANGE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-135 THIS IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS LECTURE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-136 WE ARE NOT GOING TO CALL IT THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-137 THE COMPUTER DOESN'T MIND BUT THE HUMAN DOES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-138 YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE DIRECTION FIELD FOR YOURSELF
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-139 THIS IS THE SAME AS THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-140 THIS IS HOW HE CALCULATED THE DIRECTION FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-141 IT LOOKS BETTER IF YOU DON'T
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-142 HOW DOES HE PLUG IT INTO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-143 HE IS TRYING TO TRANSLATE WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-144 I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO WRITE THAT ON THE BOARD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-145 THIS IS A SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-146 I AM GEOMETRICALLY DRAWING AN INTEGRAL CURVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-147 THIS IS THE DIRECTION OF THE FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-148 IT HAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-149 SO THIS IS THE INTEGRAL CURVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-150 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IN MIND
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-151 WHAT IS A SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-152 YOU FILL UP THE PLANE WITH THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-153 YOU DRAW A LITTLE LINE ELEMENT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-154 THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING IN HIGH SCHOOL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-155 THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED A DIRECTION FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-156 THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION HAS MANY SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-157 YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-158 YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN FUNCTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-159 THOSE EQUATIONS ARE THE RULES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-160 THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-161 THERE ARE NO ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-162 THIS ONE IS EASILY SOLVABLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-163 THAT IS PRETTY SIMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-164 WE CAN'T ALWAYS DO THIS VERY WELL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-165 WE WILL ISOLATE THE DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-166 I THINK THAT THEY KNOW THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-167 THE BOOK HAS A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-168 DIFFERENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS MAY HAVE SIMILAR MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-169 HOWEVER THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-170 THIS DOES NOT COMPLETELY DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-171 ACOUSTIC SIGNALS ARE SPEECH OR AUDIO SIGNALS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-172 ELECTRICAL SIGNALS ARE VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS IN A CIRCUIT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-173 SIGNALS ARE FUNCTIONS OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-174 THIS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE STUDY OF LOGIC
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-175 THIS IS NOT A MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-176 THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT IN THE STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-177 THE THEOREM HAS NO EXCEPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-178 IT IS NOT EXISTENCE THAT FAILS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-179 THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THIS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-180 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-181 THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-182 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE LINE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-183 IT DOES WHAT IT HAS TO DO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-184 THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-185 HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK THE ANSWER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-186 THIS IS A MORE COMPLICATED EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-187 THE OBJECT IS IMPLIED BUT NOT STATED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-188 IT IS NOT LIMITED BY EXCEPTIONS OR RESTRICTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-189 HE IS JUST USING THE ABSOLUTE VALUE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-190 HE IS TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-191 HE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE MAIN PURPOSE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-192 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY PREDICTION AT ALL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-193 HOW DO THEY CALCULATE THE SECOND DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-194 THEY WOULDN'T NEED THIS ANYWAY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-195 THERE IS JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM LEFT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-196 HE CAN LEARN THOSE WORDS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-197 LET'S SAY HERE WAS THE STARTING POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-198 THAT IS NOT AN OPTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-199 HOW CAN HE ANSWER SUCH A QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-200 HE DIDN'T TELL YOU WHERE TO STOP
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-201 THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-202 HE HAS TO CALCULATE THE NEW SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-203 HE HAS TO MULTIPLY THIS BY THIS NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-204 THEY ARE STARTING TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-205 OTHERWISE YOU WILL FORGET IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-206 THEY HAVE TO SEE WHERE THE MISTAKES ARE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-207 THEY HAVE TO FIND THE MISTAKES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-208 IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO BE SYSTEMATIC
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-209 HOW DO THE SOLUTIONS BEHAVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-210 THIS IS A NONTRIVIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-211 THIS IS HIS INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-212 HE WILL USE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-213 THIS IS WHAT HE CAN TELL YOU
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-214 THAT IS THE TRIVIAL PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-215 HOW FAR DO WE HAVE TO GO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-216 THIS SIDE OF THE TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT LENGTH
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-217 THIS IS THE OLD POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-218 IT IS THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-219 HOW DOES HE TAKE THE NEXT STEP
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-220 HE IS GOING TO DRAW A PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-221 THIS IS WHAT YOU PREFER TO SEE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-222 THE COMPUTER IS SIMPLY CALCULATING THIS POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-223 THE NEXT STEP OF THE PROCESS WILL CARRY YOU TO THAT PLACE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-224 YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH THAT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-225 WHAT INFORMATION DO WE HAVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-226 THIS IS THE METHOD WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-227 THIS IS THE INITIAL CONDITION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-228 THIS IS OUR FIRST ORDER PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-229 THE COMPUTER IS CALCULATING THE SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12/wav/en12-230 I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-001 THE COMPUTER WILL GET LOST IN ETERNITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-002 HOW DOES THE CURVE ACTUALLY LOOK
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-003 THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY COMPLICATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-004 SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE SOLUTION IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-005 THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-006 THIS WILL JUST DESTROY THEIR FAITH IN THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-007 THEY HAVE TO CALCULATE THOSE SLOPES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-008 THEY HAVE TO DRAW ALL THOSE CURVES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-009 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE USING
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-010 HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE FUNCTION HAVE TO BE EVALUATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-011 WHY SHOULD THEY USE ANYTHING ELSE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-012 THEY ARE GOING TO DECREASE THE ERROR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-013 THE ERROR VARIES WITH THE STEP SIZE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-014 THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER METHOD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-015 THEY MAKE A TEMPORARY CHOICE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-016 THE COMPUTER KNOWS WHAT THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-017 DOES HE HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-018 HE HAS TO GET THE RIGHT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-019 THIS IS A TEMPORARY VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-020 YOU CAN USE THIS INSTEAD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-021 THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-022 HE HAS TO DRAW THIS PARALLEL LINE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-023 HE IS INTERESTED IN SOLVING THOSE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-024 THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD TRY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-025 HE IS TRYING TO IMPROVE THAT SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-026 THEY HAVE TO FIND A BETTER VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-027 THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-028 THEY JUST HAVE THE NEXT STEP
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-029 HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE SOLUTION IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-030 HE IS TRYING TO SWITCH FROM ONE VARIABLE TO THE OTHER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-031 HE CAN THINK OF IT AS A GENERAL LINEAR EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-032 HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT LET'S FORGET ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-033 HOW COULD THE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGE OVER TIME
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-034 HE IS TRYING TO SOLVE THESE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-035 IT IS THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-036 THIS IS FOR THE SAME REASON
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-037 IT IS CALLED THE DIFFUSION EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-038 THIS IS THE EXTERNAL CONCENTRATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-039 SHE CAN TRAVEL IN VARIOUS WAYS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-040 THERE ARE LESS IMPORTANT MODELS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-041 IT OCCURS IN A VARIETY OF MODELS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-042 WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-043 IT SHOULDN'T BE WRITTEN THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-044 THIS IS A FORM WHICH HE WILL NEVER USE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-045 HOW ABOUT THE LEFT-HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-046 THIS IS A STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-047 THAT IS THE EQUATION THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-048 THIS IS EXTREMELY LIMITED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-049 HE WILL FIND SOME OTHER FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-050 HE WILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-051 THEY ARE SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-052 HE DISCOVERED THE POWER SERIES EXPANSIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-053 HE IS WELL KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT USE OF POWER SERIES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-054 THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE PROGRESS IN THE FIELD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-055 THE FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO THE ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-056 SHE TRIED TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF A FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-057 HE INTRODUCED SEVERAL NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-058 THE NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER OF TOPICS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-059 MANY OF HIS WORKS ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-060 HIS IMPORTANCE IN THE HISTORY CANNOT BE OVERSTATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-061 HE WORKED IN ALMOST ALL AREAS OF MATHEMATICS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-062 HE INTRODUCED MUCH OF THE MATHEMATICAL TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-063 HE MADE IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN SEVERAL FIELDS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-064 THIS IS THE FINAL EXAM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-065 THE RELATIVITY THEORY IS TOO ABSTRACT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-066 THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-067 THEY HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO THE SAME POLARITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-068 SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THE TRANSITION IS MADE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-069 I AM GOING TO LOOK AT THIS PART
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-070 THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE MATRIX FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-071 THEY ARE SHARING THESE RESOURCES AS A SERVICE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-072 SUPPLEMENTARY RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-073 THIS IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF MINUS ONE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-074 HE WILL COME BACK TO THIS NEXT WEEK
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-075 HE IS MAKING THIS A DUMMY VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-076 THIS IS DONE IN THE VERY FIRST SECTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-077 HE CAN PUT IT ON THE OUTSIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-078 SHE WILL WRITE IT IN THE COMPACT FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-079 IT HAS TO BE COMPATIBLE ON BOTH SIDES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-080 THEY HAVE TO PUT IT INTO THE POSITION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-081 THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-082 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-083 WHY DON'T THEY CONCENTRATE ON THE MOST INTERESTING CASE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-084 THEY CAN DO THIS IN GENERAL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-085 WE CAN COMPLETE THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-086 HE WANTS TO MAKE IT A BIT MORE OF A PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-087 THEY FOUND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-088 MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES BY THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-089 THEY ARE DOING JUST ONE RESEARCH
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-090 THIS IS THE FORMULA FOR THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-091 HE THINKS IT WILL BE BETTER TO SUMMARIZE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-092 WE CAN SOLVE THAT BUT PLEASE DON'T FORGET THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-093 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-094 DO YOU SEE HOW REASONABLE THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-095 HE IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-096 HE THINKS IT IS THE BEST
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-097 SHE WORKS VERY ACCURATELY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-098 SHE IS PERFORMING AND ACTING WITH CARE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-099 HE IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A CORRECT READING
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-100 THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND A SUBSET OF THE ORIGINAL VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-101 A PHYSICAL SYSTEM EXISTS IN THREE DIMENSIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-102 IT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FEATURE EXTRACTION AND FEATURE SELECTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-103 IT IS THE PROCESS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF RANDOM VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-104 IT WILL EXTRACT THE RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THE INPUT DATA
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-105 THIS IS A POSITIVE CHARGE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-106 THESE BOUNDARIES ARE GROUNDED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-107 WE CAN MEASURE THE CHARGE ON THE GROUND PLANE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-108 IT HAS THE SAME POTENTIAL AS THE SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-109 HE PERFORMED A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-110 THE ELECTRIC CURRENT PRODUCES A MAGNETIC FIELD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-111 IT CONFIRMED A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-112 HE IS GOING TO PUT THIS INTO THE EXPONENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-113 THAT IS READY TO BE INTEGRATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-114 HE HAS TO PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-115 THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-116 THEY CAN SOLVE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-117 THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-118 WHAT IS THE SLOPE OF THE WHOLE PATH
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-119 THIS ANGLE WILL BE RELATED TO THE SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-120 LET'S INTRODUCE A COORDINATE SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-121 THIS IS A PROBLEM IN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-122 WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO THEY HAVE ABOUT THE FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-123 THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE A CURVE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-124 WHAT IS THE PATH OF THE BOAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-125 HE HAS TO DRAW THE BEAM A LITTLE LESS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-126 THEY HAVE TO SEPARATE THE VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-127 THIS WILL BE SOLVED BY AN EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-128 THIS EQUATION CAN BE SOLVED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-129 HE HAS TURNED THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-130 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-131 FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-132 THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A DIRECT SUBSTITUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-133 IT IS NOT OBVIOUS WHAT TO DO AT THAT POINT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-134 WHY WOULD SHE BE TALKING ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-135 THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-136 THEY HAVE THE SAME COMMON SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-137 THIS IS THE RIGHT WORD TO DESCRIBE THEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-138 HE WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO THE SECOND METHOD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-139 SHE IS STARTING FROM THIS FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-140 HE HAS TO TURN THIS EXPRESSION UPSIDE DOWN
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-141 IT WASN'T THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-142 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-143 HE IS NOT SURE WHAT HE GETS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-144 THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE ASKED TO SOLVE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-145 LET'S PUT THAT IN STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-146 SO THIS IS ONE DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-147 THEY HAVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-148 THEY HAVE FOUND A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-149 THIS IS A CONSTANT FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-150 WHAT IS THE DERIVATIVE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-151 THIS IS WHY THEY ARE DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-152 THE EQUATION IS UNSOLVABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-153 THEY FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-154 LET'S ASSUME THAT IT IS NOT ZERO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-155 WHAT KIND OF EQUATION WOULD THIS BE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-156 THIS IS THE FIRST THING THAT HE WANTS TO DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-157 SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-158 HE HAS TO START WITH THE DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-159 HE WANTS TO DO THIS KIND OF INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-160 HE DID THE INVERSE SUBSTITUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-161 THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF SUBSTITUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-162 THERE IS ONE LESS CONSTANT IN THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-163 HE HAS TO INDICATE THAT IT IS THE SAME EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-164 HE CAN DIVIDE BOTH NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-165 IT IS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-166 HOW SHOULD I SCALE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-167 THIS IS WHAT THEY CAN DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-168 THIS IS A BIG TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-169 THIS IS THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-170 THIS APPLIES AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-171 YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE COORDINATE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-172 THOSE ARE THE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-173 WHAT DOES THE VARIABLE ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-174 THIS IS THE KIND OF EQUATION I AM TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-175 I WILL GIVE YOU SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLES OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-176 THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO KINDS OF EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-177 HE KNOWS HOW TO SOLVE TWO KINDS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-178 WE ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-179 THE DETERMINANT IS NOT ZERO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-180 THEY CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE MATRIX
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-181 MAYBE EVEN NOW WE CAN SAY THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-182 THEY CAN SOLVE THOSE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-183 THAT IS ANOTHER KEY PROPERTY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-184 WHAT ARE THEIR PROPERTIES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-185 THIS IS ANOTHER WORD FOR INVERTIBLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-186 TELL ME SOME FACTS ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-187 THE FIRST LECTURE WILL BE WITHIN MINUTES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-188 HE HAS TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-189 AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-190 THIS HAS THE SAME STRUCTURE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-191 WHAT DO THEY SEE IN THAT MATRIX
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-192 THE SECOND PART IS SOLVING THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13/wav/en13-193 HE HAS TO FIND THE EQUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-01 IT DEPENDS EXACTLY ON HOW THE TEMPERATURE VARIES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-02 SHE WILL PUT IN THE ARBITRARY CONSTANT EXPLICITLY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-03 WE NEED ONLY A SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-04 THERE IS NO NEED TO INCLUDE THE INTEGRATING CONSTANT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-05 AND WHAT IS THE RESULTING EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-06 THE NAME COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT IS AN INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-07 IT SHOWS AS A MULTIPLE IN THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-08 WHY DON'T WE CONCENTRATE ON THE CONSTANT COEFFICIENT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-09 THEY CAN DO THIS IN GENERAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-100 THEY ARE DEFINITELY ALLOWED TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-101 HE IS TRYING TO SEPARATE THE IMAGINARY PART
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-102 WHAT IS THE DERIVATIVE OF THE GENERIC VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-103 THIS TELLS HIM WHAT HE HAS TO CHECK
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-104 THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-105 THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-106 HOW DO THEY DIFFERENTIATE SUCH A THING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-107 THIS IS A COMPLEX VALUE FUNCTION OF A REAL VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-108 WHAT IS COMING OUT IS A COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-109 HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE IT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-10 THE LEFT-HAND SIDE CAN NOW BE INTEGRATED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-110 THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-111 SHE WILL USE THE METHOD OF GROUPING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-112 THEY HAVE TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCT OF THESE TWO THINGS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-113 THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SERIES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-114 WHY IS IT SUCH A POPULAR FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-115 HE REALIZES A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-116 THIS WILL GET MORE FAMILIAR TO YOU
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-117 HE THINKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-118 SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THIS DOESN'T WORK
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-119 HE HAS TO PUT DOWN THE REAL PART
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-11 I WANT TO GIVE YOU A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-120 IT IS DIVIDED BY A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-121 THEY WANT TO CALCULATE THOSE NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-122 YOU CAN ALWAYS MULTIPLY THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-123 IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN IT USED TO BE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-124 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LOGISTIC EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-125 HOW CAN I MULTIPLY COMPLEX NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-126 THERE ARE ALWAYS DIFFERENT ANSWERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-127 IT IS A COMPLETELY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-128 THIS COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE PRODUCT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-129 THAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-12 YOU CAN FOLLOW YOUR NOTES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-130 THEY WANT THE REAL PART OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-13 THIS IS DOING WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-14 THAT IS GOING TO GIVE HIM PROBLEMS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-15 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-16 PLEASE INCLUDE THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-17 THEY ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-18 HE DOESN'T PUT IT IN STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-19 I THINK I SHOULD WARN YOU
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-20 YOU CAN FIND THE DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-21 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT SHE FORGOT SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-22 HE IS GOING TO WRITE IT THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-23 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-24 WHAT IS THE FIRST THING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-25 YOU HAVE TO FIND THE INTEGRAL FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-26 THIS IS A NEGATIVE SIGN
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-27 HE WROTE IT IN A DIFFERENT FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-28 THEY BETTER GET THE RIGHT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-29 YOU MUST PUT IT IN THIS FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-30 THIS IS THE METHOD FOR SOLVING THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-31 SO LET'S DO THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-32 AND THAT IS THE WAY WE SOLVE THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-33 THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL FORMULA
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-34 EVERYTHING GETS SO COMPLICATED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-35 ALL HE WANTS IS A SINGLE VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-36 SHE IS GOING TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-37 SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-38 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO BE EQUAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-39 WHAT IS THE CONDITION THAT HE HAS TO SATISFY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-40 SEE HOW REASONABLE THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-41 HE HAS CHOSEN THEM SO CLEVERLY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-42 THIS IS THE DERIVATIVE OF SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-43 HE WANTED TO MULTIPLY THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-44 HERE IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-45 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-46 HE HAS COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD FIGHT WITH HIM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-47 THIS IS THE WAY HE IS GOING TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-48 THERE IS ALWAYS A TRICK INVOLVED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-49 THEY HAVE TO LEARN THAT THIS IS AN EIGENVALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-50 IT WILL HAVE AN EIGENVALUE OF ONE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-51 THIS HAPPENS TO BE A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-52 SO THAT IS WHAT IS COMING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-53 THIS WILL BE TOTALLY CONNECTED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-54 THEY CAN SEE HOW THIS WORKS JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-55 THIS IS A STABLE CRITICAL POINT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-56 IT IS JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE ZERO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-57 THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSLATIONS OF EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-58 THEY ARE INCREASING IN BETWEEN THE TWO CURVES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-59 HOW DO THESE OTHER SOLUTIONS LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-60 HE IS GOING TO MAKE THAT SAME ANALYSIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-61 THOSE ARE POSITIVE NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-62 THERE ARE HIS THREE CRITICAL POINTS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-63 THEY TRY TO GET THE BASIC INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-64 HE WAS GOING TO WRITE IT ON THE BOARD FOR THEM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-65 HE HAS TO USE THOSE FRACTIONS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-66 THIS IS THE SIMPLE POPULATION GROWTH
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-67 HE IS TRYING TO GET USED TO THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-68 THIS EQUATION DESCRIBES HOW POPULATION INCREASES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-69 THIS IS A POPULAR EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-70 HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE TIME FOR THEM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-71 IT IS STILL GOING TO DECREASE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-72 HE ONLY HAS TO DRAW TWO OF THOSE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-73 THAT REPRESENTS THE RATE OF CHANGE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-74 WHAT IS SHE GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT LINE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-75 THE INTERCEPT IS DOWN HERE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-76 HE IS GOING TO USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-77 WHAT DO THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-78 THERE IS DEFINITELY A HORIZONTAL SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-79 SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-80 THERE IS ONLY ONE CRITICAL POINT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-81 SHE WANTS TO ANALYZE THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-82 THAT IS THE WAY YOU MAKE PROGRESS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-83 THE SOLUTION WILL BE DECREASING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-84 HE IS GOING TO SHOW THEM MORE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-85 THAT REALLY LIMITS THEIR BEHAVIOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-86 THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATING A CONSTANT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-87 THEY ARE TRYING TO GET A LOT OF INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-88 WHY ISN'T SHE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-89 SHE IS NOT READY TO DO THE CALCULATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-90 HE WOULD SKIP A COUPLE OF THESE STEPS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-91 THEY MAY HAVE SOME DOUBTS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-92 WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-93 THE SAME THING IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR THE INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-94 HE CANNOT TRUST HIS MEMORY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-95 HE IS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-96 HE WOULD LIKE TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-97 THOSE ARE THE ABSOLUTE VALUES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-98 HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT MAGNITUDE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14/wav/en14-99 THIS IS THE POLAR FORM OF THE COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-001 HE WOULDN'T EXPECT EVERYBODY TO GET THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-002 THE DENOMINATOR IS BECOMING SMALLER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-003 THIS NUMBER DESCRIBES WHERE YOU ARE ON THE COSINE CYCLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-004 YOU ARE BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-005 NOW THEY KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-006 THEY ALL KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-007 IT IS JUST THE BEST WAY TO DRAW THAT PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-008 SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE REAL PART OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-009 WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO OUR REAL PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-010 WHAT IS THE ANGLE GOING TO BE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-011 THE ARGUMENT TURNS INTO ITS NEGATIVE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-012 AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-013 THIS IS THE ANGLE OF ONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-014 THIS IS THE NUMBER HE IS INTERESTED IN
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-015 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-016 THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-017 AFTER SHE GETS THE ANSWER SHE HAS TO MULTIPLY THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-018 SHE HAS TO SUBSTITUTE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-019 SHE WILL TAKE THE FINAL STEP
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-020 SHE HAS TO INTEGRATE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-021 HE IS VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-022 HE HAS TO MULTIPLY IT BY BOTH SIDES
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-023 JUST USE THE INTEGRATING FACTORS JUST DO IT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-024 I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-025 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-026 THIS WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-027 THAT IS THE REAL PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-028 THAT IS A COMPLEX SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-029 HE HAS TO FIND THE COMPLEX SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-030 THE REAL FUNCTION SOLVES THE PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-031 THIS IS EASIER TO INTEGRATE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-032 IT IS THE WAY IT IS USUALLY DONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-033 THEY GOT TO SOLVE THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-034 IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO REPEAT ITSELF
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-035 THIS IS A LOT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO TODAY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-036 THIS IS WHAT SHE IS INTERESTED IN
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-037 HE WILL BE STUDYING IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS OR SO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-038 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-039 THIS IS A LITTLE CALCULATION THAT HAS TO BE DONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-040 THIS IS THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-041 THIS ASSUMES THAT THE NUMBER HAS TO BE GREATER THAN ZERO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-042 THIS ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-043 I AM TRYING TO GET RID OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-044 THERE IS NO STANDARD WAY OF DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-045 THE DATE AND TIME CAN BE CALCULATED FROM THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-046 THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-047 HE CAN SHOW YOU ON MONDAY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-048 THIS IS THE TEMPERATURE CONCENTRATION MODEL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-049 THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE USUALLY TRYING TO CALCULATE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-050 HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER METHOD
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-051 THIS IS THE REPRESENTATION OF THIS COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-052 HE HAS TO FILE A REPORT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-053 YOU HAVE GOT MY FAX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-054 THERE IS SOME PEOPLE OUTSIDE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-055 HE WON'T LET GO YOU ARE DOING GREAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-056 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-057 SO PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME FOR DOING THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-058 SHE THINKS THEY SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-059 WE DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO TALK
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-060 THAT IS A LOT TO REMEMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-061 CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-062 I WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-063 THIS HARDLY REQUIRES PROOF
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-064 YOU HAVE JUST WHAT YOU STARTED WITH
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-065 IT TURNS OUT THIS IS AMAZINGLY EASY TO DO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-066 WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A DIFFERENT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-067 IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A REAL NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-068 SO THIS SOLUTION IS CALLED STABLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-069 SO THIS IS THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-070 THE FIRST STEP IS TO FIND THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-071 WHY IS THE PARTICULAR SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-072 YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-073 THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-074 THIS IS THE EXTERNAL FORCE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-075 THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-076 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS VERY WELL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-077 SOMETIMES THERE IS NO SUBSCRIPT AT ALL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-078 YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-079 THIS IS THE SOLUTION WE KNOW
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-080 THEY HAVE TO REDUCE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-081 UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SINGLE NAME
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-082 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED THE OUTPUT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-083 THIS PART HAS A LOT OF NAMES
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-084 THEY HAVE TO FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-085 THE EQUATION IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-086 WHAT CAN WE SAY FOR SURE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-087 THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TURN OUT THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-088 WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL TO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-089 SHE WERE RIGHT BEFORE FRIENDS ARE SO IMPORTANT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-090 THEY HAVE HEARD THE SPECIALS THREE TIMES
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-091 THEY WENT TO COLLEGE WITH BOTH OF THEM
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-092 THE FULL SET OF OPTIONS IS GIVEN BELOW
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-093 THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-094 YOU ARE IN NO POSITION TO SAY YES OR NO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-095 HE WILL USE ALL THE OTHER SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-096 HE WILL DO ONE MORE SIMPLE EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-097 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-098 YOU CAN SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-099 I AM CALCULATING THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15/wav/en15-100 HERE IS THE MAIN THING I WANT TO SHOW YOU
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-01 ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WILL EVER KNOW ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-02 WHY IS SHE DOING THIS TO HERSELF
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-03 SHE IS SUPPOSED TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-04 HE IS DEMANDING A FULL PRESIDENTIAL PARDON
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-05 MAKE SURE HE STAYS AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-06 WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-07 IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO PRODUCE RESULTS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-08 HE IS NOT BUYING A USED CAR
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-09 CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU GET THERE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-10 HE DOESN'T TRUST THE AMBASSADOR
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-11 HE CAN'T GIVE HIM THIS INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-12 HE WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-13 AND THEY ARE PREPARED FOR AN EXCHANGE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-14 THEY HAVE TO COME WITH US
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-15 CAN I TRUST YOU WITH THIS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-16 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-17 WHAT YOU JUST DID IS GOING TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-18 HER DISK IS PARTITIONED IN OVER TWENTY VOLUMES
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-19 DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IS IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-20 THE TRANSFER DIDN'T COMPLETE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-21 DOES SHE REMEMBER THE ENCRYPTION CODES
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-22 THEY LOST A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-23 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE

ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-27 THIS HAS BEEN TOTALLY DESTROYED
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-28 I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-29 I ONLY MET HER TWICE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-30 YOU DON'T THINK I DID THIS

ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-52 HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THAT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-53 THIS IS THE ONLY THING HE IS GOING TO SPECIFY
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-54 THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17/wav/en17-55 WHY IS SHE COVERING HER FACE

ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-72 THE WATER IS CIRCULATING IN A NETWORK OF PIPES
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-73 THIS CAN LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-74 WHICH POINT IS THE REFERENCE POINT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-75 THE ELECTRON IS MOVING ACROSS THE VOLTAGE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-76 VOLTAGE IS A PROPERTY OF AN ELECTRIC FIELD
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-77 THIS TERM IS STILL USED IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-78 THE DIFFERENCE CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE ABILITY TO MOVE CHARGE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-79 IT TENDS TO PUSH ELECTRONS FROM ONE POINT TO THE OTHER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-80 THIS DIFFERENCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20/wav/en20-81 THIS IS KNOWN AS THE ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-28 IT CAN BE REDEFINED USING THE OPTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-29 IT DELETES THEM WHEN WRITING OUT THE DICTIONARY

ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-31 THEY ARE DESCRIBED IN THE REFERENCE SECTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-32 THOSE WORDS ARE NOT IN THE MAIN DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-33 EACH SCRIPT HAS THE SAME NAME AS THE CORRESPONDING SOURCE DICTIONARY

ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-43 THEY HAVE TO COPY THE ENTRY TO THE OUTPUT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-44 THE BASIC OPERATION IS TO SCAN THE INPUT STREAMS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-45 EACH DICTIONARY FILE MUST HAVE ONE PRONUNCIATION PER LINE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-46 HE NEEDS SOMETHING CONCRETE

ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-84 NOTHING WAS OUT OF CONTROL
ralfherzog-20071125-en21/wav/en21-85 THINGS WERE OUT OF CONTROL

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-33 THE RECOGNITION RESULTS CAN BE SEEN
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-34 BOTH OF THE ABOVE CAN BE USED TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-35 THIS CAN BE OBTAINED BY SETTING THE SIGNAL TO A POSITIVE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-36 IT IS BEING USED AS A START CONTROL
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-37 THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE INTERRUPT SIGNAL
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-38 INPUT IS TO BE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-39 THEY ARE DONE FOR TODAY

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-41 THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-42 WHAT IS THEIR PRIORITY
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-43 ALL OTHER CLASSES ARE EMPTY

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-47 THEY NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-48 HE BROUGHT A SECONDARY DETONATOR
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-49 THEY WERE DESTROYING AN EMPTY BUILDING
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-50 COULD YOU GIVE US A SAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-51 YOU ARE A DOUBLE AGENT
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-52 SHE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-53 THIS WILL LEAD TO SMALL VALUES
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-54 WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-55 HE WILL TALK TO ME

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-62 SHE THOUGHT THE JOB WOULD BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-63 BUT FIRST SHE HAD TO WIN BACK THEIR CONFIDENCE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-64 IT IS TYPICALLY CHOSEN BY A SIMPLE METHOD
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-65 THIS IS ORGANIZED CRIME
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-66 THEY STARTED A COMPANY TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-67 THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-69 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-70 IT WAS THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-71 SHE HAD TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-72 THIS IS TYPICALLY CHOSEN BY A SIMPLE METHOD
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-73 I THINK WE CAN ARRANGE THAT
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-74 IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-75 SHE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-76 THEY OFFERED ME A JOB
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-77 THEY WANTED TO INTERVIEW ME

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-81 THIS THING IS COMPLETELY INSANE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-82 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-83 YOU AND I DON'T WORK WELL TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-84 WILL YOU REMIND THEM THAT SHE COOPERATED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-85 THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A SEQUENCE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-86 THE CLASS CONTAINS MORE THAN ONE WORD
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-87 WE ARE CALLING IT THE PROPHECY
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-88 THE CONCEPT CAN BE EXPRESSED MORE GENERALLY
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-89 THEY HAD THE SAME KEY

ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-94 YOU HAVE TO TRAIN THEM ON PRECISE ACOUSTIC TRANSCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-95 HE WILL REPAY THE FAVOR
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-96 OUR CONVERSATIONS WERE NEVER RECORDED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-97 LANGUAGE MODELS ARE TO BE USED FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-98 THEY ARE EQUALLY SHARING THE BURDEN OF COST
ralfherzog-20071126-en25/wav/en25-99 THEY COME TOGETHER TODAY TO MAKE A DECISION
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-01 HE IS BETTER LOOKING THAN ME
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-02 HE IS MORE INTERESTED IN HIS GRANDSON
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-03 THIS DEMANDS MORE STORAGE SPACE
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-04 HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT PAGE
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-05 YOU ARE LEAVING FOR LONDON

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-08 IT DOESN'T MATCH THE PAGES IN THE MANUSCRIPT
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-09 THIS IS DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS SECTION
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-10 IT IS THE STORAGE SPACE THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-11 THIS IS THE CODE KEY
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-12 THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-13 THEY WILL NOT BE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TIMES
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-14 THIS IS ALMOST WORTH THE RISK
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-15 MAYBE WE CAN CHECK IT OUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-16 HOW FAR UNDER TWENTY

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-22 THEY WOULD HAVE TO FLY OUT SEPARATELY
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-23 SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-24 HE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE CARE OF HIS PROBLEM HIMSELF
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-25 PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ANYONE
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-26 IT IS THE SET OF WORDS IN THE LANGUAGE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-27 I NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-28 HE IS WATCHING THEM CLOSELY

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-30 THE AGENCY WON'T GO AFTER IT

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-37 SHE WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-38 SHE WAS SO TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-39 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-40 I PROBABLY COULD HAVE SURVIVED

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-43 I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-44 THIS CAN BE DECOMPOSED AS THE PRODUCT OF PROBABILITIES

ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-49 WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-50 THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-51 I DO HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-52 HE KNOWS HE IS A TARGET
ralfherzog-20071126-en26/wav/en26-53 SO THEY ARE FACING THE RUSSIAN MAFIA

ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-74 YOU HAVE TO FIND THE COMMON FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-75 THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-76 IT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRESSURE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-77 I WAS WORKING WITH THESE PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-78 IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-79 THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-80 WHAT IS THE MATTER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-81 THEY HAVE GOT TO RUN

ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-83 THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-84 THE LANGUAGE MODEL CAN BE BUILT IN SEVERAL STEPS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-85 THIS GENERATES THE REQUIRED LANGUAGE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-86 YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME THE SOCIAL NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-87 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-88 THE TOOL CAN USE A CLASS MAP
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-89 HE IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THEM
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-90 HE FINDS ME USEFUL IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-91 HERE IS MY QUESTION

ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-98 ANY WORD CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH A CLASS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27/wav/en27-99 THIS IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF A MORE GENERAL MECHANISM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-01 THE NEXT STAGE IN THE PROCESS IS TO DEFINE THE VOCABULARY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-02 YOU WOULD BE PUTTING ALL OF THAT AT RISK
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-03 YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-04 YOU CANNOT TELL HIM THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-05 YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-06 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT THIS

ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-10 COULD YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THIS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-11 THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-12 I WILL BE RIGHT THERE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-13 THE MAIN STEPS OF THIS PROCEDURE ARE ILLUSTRATED
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-14 THE RESULTING LANGUAGE MODEL IS READY FOR USE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28/wav/en28-15 HE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT THE AGENCY

Revelation2221-20080510-dtx/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
Revelation2221-20080510-dtx/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
Revelation2221-20080510-dtx/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
Revelation2221-20080510-dtx/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
Revelation2221-20080510-dtx/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
rharrison-20090911-frt/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
Rhyhann-20080518-bra/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
richard-20090818-byw/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
richard-20090818-sgv/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
richard-20090820-dec/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
richard-20090820-hvi/wav/b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE

richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
richard-20090820-hzf/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL

richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
richard-20090820-ihy/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER

richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
richard-20090820-msf/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
richard-20090820-nfp/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
richard-20090820-omz/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
richard-20090820-poa/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
richard-20090820-qse/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
richard-20090820-wjl/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
richard-20090820-yqo/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
richard-20090821-kom/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
richard-20090828-soi/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER

rjmunro-20080517-pwp/wav/a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
rjmunro-20080517-pwp/wav/a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER

rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
rjmunro-20080517-win/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0445 JOY I MURMURED
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER

rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL

rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
rjmunro-20090210-col/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0301 DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
rjmunro-20090210-euv/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY

rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
rjmunro-20090210-hhv/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS

rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
rjmunro-20090210-jbe/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0313 YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
rjmunro-20090210-kyd/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
rjmunro-20090210-rza/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0145 HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
rjmunro-20090210-tvi/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0267 HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0268 GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
rjmunro-20090210-ufe/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0448 HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
rjmunro-20090210-vch/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
rjmunro-20090210-yux/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
rjmunro-20090213-ljs/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
rjmunro-20090213-xte/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL

rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
rmmg-20080715-nao/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-01 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-02 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-03 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-04 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-05 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-06 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-07 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-08 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-09 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-10 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-11 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-12 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-13 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-14 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-15 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-16 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-17 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-18 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-19 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-20 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY

robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-23 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-24 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-25 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-26 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION

robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-28 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-29 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-30 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-31 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-32 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-33 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf11/wav/vf11-34 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS

robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD

robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-07 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-08 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-20 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-21 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf12/wav/vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-01 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-02 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-03 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-04 NO-SIR-EE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-05 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-06 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE-LEGGED BOY REPLIED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf13/wav/vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-22 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-28 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-30 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-31 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-32 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-33 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-34 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-35 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-36 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-37 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
robertburrelldonkin-200709011-vf14/wav/vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-arthur/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-cc/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE

robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070902-rp/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-01 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-02 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-03 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-04 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-05 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-06 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-07 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-08 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-09 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-10 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf1/wav/vf1-40 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-01 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-02 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-03 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-04 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-05 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-06 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-07 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-08 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-09 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-10 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-11 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-12 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-13 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-14 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-15 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-16 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-17 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-18 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-19 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-20 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-21 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-22 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-23 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-24 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-25 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-26 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-27 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-28 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-29 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-30 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-31 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-32 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-33 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-34 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-35 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-36 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-37 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-38 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-39 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
robertburrelldonkin-20070904-vf2/wav/vf2-40 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-01 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-03 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-07 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-09 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf3/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-01 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-02 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-03 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-04 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-05 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-08 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf4/wav/vf4-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-01 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-02 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-03 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-04 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-05 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-06 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING

robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED

robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf5/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED

robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-03 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-04 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-05 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS

robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE

robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
robertburrelldonkin-20070905-vf6/wav/vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION

robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf15/wav/vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf15/wav/vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf15/wav/vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf16/wav/vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf17/wav/vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM

robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-20 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-21 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-22 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-23 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-24 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-25 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-26 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-27 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-28 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-29 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-30 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-31 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-32 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-33 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-34 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-35 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-36 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-37 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-38 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-39 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
robertburrelldonkin-20070918-vf18/wav/vf18-40 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
robertburrelldonkin-20071007-vf19/wav/vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM

Robin-20071226-fhc/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
Robin-20071226-lpr/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
Robin-20071226-pcd/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-17 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-18 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-19 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-20 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-21 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-22 SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-23 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-24 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-25 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
Robin-20071228-hwd/wav/rb-26 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
Robin-20080711-wqa/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
RobSmith-20091103-bxw/wav/b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
RobSmith-20091103-mog/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0495 WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL-DRENCHED ROADS
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
RobSmith-20091103-tds/wav/b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0407 SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
RobSmith-20091103-urx/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0475 WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
RobSmith-20091103-ypu/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY

rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
rocketman768-20080408-axr/wav/b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS

rocketman768-20080408-ejx/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
rocketman768-20080408-ejx/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART

rocketman768-20080408-hzy/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
rocketman768-20080408-hzy/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
rocketman768-20080408-hzy/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS

rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
rocketman768-20080408-ybh/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
rocketman768-20080409-oip/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
Ronin-20080326-aca/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
Ronin-20080326-arv/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Ronin-20080326-lrl/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
Ronin-20080326-odz/wav/a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0484 NO-SIR-EE
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
Ronin-20080326-rqj/wav/a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
Ronin-20080326-udk/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
Ronin-20080326-udk/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
Ronin-20080326-udk/wav/a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
Ronin-20080326-udk/wav/a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS

Ronin-20080326-udk/wav/a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Ronin-20080327-nba/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
RonnelWing-20071121-bvx/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-1 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-2 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-3 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-4 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-5 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-6 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-7 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-8 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
rortiz-20090504/wav/cc-9 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-1 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-2 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-3 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-4 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-5 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-6 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-7 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-8 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
rortiz-20090504/wav/rp-9 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-1 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-2 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-3 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-4 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-5 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-6 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING

royerfa-20080305/wav/vf5-8 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING

royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED

royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-1 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-2 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-3 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-4 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-5 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-6 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-7 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-8 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
royerfa-20080306/wav/ar-9 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-10 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-11 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-12 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-13 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-14 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-15 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-16 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-17 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-18 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-19 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-1 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-20 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-21 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-22 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-23 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-24 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-25 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-26 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-27 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-28 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-29 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-2 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-31 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-36 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-3 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-4 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-5 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-6 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-7 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-8 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
royerfa-20080307/wav/vf7-9 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-1 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-2 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-3 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-4 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-5 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-6 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-7 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-8 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
royerfa-20080309/wav/vf10-9 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
russellfeeed-20080211-upk/wav/b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
rustushki-20080901-sos/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
rustushki-20080901-usi/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
rustushki-20080901-utf/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
rustushki-20080901-vwj/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
rwtobey-20081023-dmo/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON COMMA WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR PERIOD

rwtobey-20081023-dmo/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK PERIOD
rwtobey-20081023-dmo/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
rwtobey-20081023-dmo/wav/a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED COMMA CRIED COMMA LAUGHED COMMA AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA PERIOD
rwtobey-20081023-ecg/wav/b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
rwtobey-20081023-ecg/wav/b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
rwtobey-20081023-ecg/wav/b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
rwtobey-20081023-ecg/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY

Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
Sepero-20090315-cec/wav/b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
Sepero-20090315-rek/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
Sepero-20090315-rek/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
Sepero-20090315-rek/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES

Sepero-20090315-rek/wav/b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW

Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
Sepero-20090315-wuu/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
SergioDaroca-20090909-npg/wav/b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA

SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
SF7-20071020-mur/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
shakyhand-2007-09-25/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
Shane-20080602-byw/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
Shane-20080602-kmc/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0458 EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
Shane-20080602-rgd/wav/b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0316 STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
Shane-20080602-xrq/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0044 HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
Shane-20080603-yfs/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0146 SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
Shane-20080604-icj/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
Shane-20080606-fbp/wav/a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0318 DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED-EYE'S FACE
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
Shane-20080606-qgj/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0345 NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
Shane-20080606-vwo/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0100 ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
sharrington-20081018-blu/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
sharrington-20081018-lmj/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
sharrington-20081018-mux/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
sharrington-20081018-ncv/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARK
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
sharrington-20081018-rgy/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED
sharrington-20081018-ucg/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
sharrington-20081018-uuu/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
sharrington-20081018-ygq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT NEWS
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
sharrington-20081018-yqy/wav/b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
sharrington-20081018-zkw/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
shashibg-20090103-hus/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
ShingoTamai-20080918-wkt/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
ShingoTamai-20080918-zlq/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE-GIVING LIFE-CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
Shishir-20091211-dom/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
Shishire-20080801-kmo/wav/b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
sil-20090322/wav/cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
sil-20090322/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
sil-20090322/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
sil-20090322/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
sil-20090322/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
sil-20090322/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
sil-20090322/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
sil-20090322/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
sil-20090322/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
sil-20090322/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
sil-20090322/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
sil-20090322/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
sil-20090322/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
sil-20090322/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
sil-20090322/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
sil-20090322/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
sil-20090322/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
sil-20090322/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
sil-20090322/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
sil-20090322/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
sil-20090322/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
sil-20090322/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
sil-20090322/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
sil-20090322/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
sil-20090322/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
sil-20090322/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
sil-20090322/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
sil-20090322/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
sil-20090322/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
simcop2387-20080324-psl/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Simon-20081003-liu/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY

simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
simonmcandrew-20081114-zoz/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD

simulant-20090912/wav/ar--10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
simulant-20090912/wav/ar--11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME

simulant-20090912/wav/ar--15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
simulant-20090912/wav/ar--16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY

southernman-20091030-iwt/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
southernman-20091030-iwt/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
southernman-20091030-iwt/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
southernman-20091030-iwt/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
southernman-20091030-iwt/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
southernman-20091031-iyz/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
squilla-20070519/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
src105-20090728-yal/wav/b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
sriram-20100118-qyz/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK

starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0004 FAMILIAR LETTERS ON CHEMISTRY BY JUSTUS LIEBIG LETTER FOURTEEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0005 NATURE AND EFFECTS OF MANURES ANIMAL BODIES SUBJECT TO CONSTANT WASTE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0006 PARTS SEPARATING EXUVIAE WASTE VEGETABLE MATTERS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0007 TOGETHER CONTAIN ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE SOIL AND OF FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0008 VARIOUS VALUE OF EXCREMENTS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS AS MANURE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0009 MY DEAR SIR I TREATED IN MY LAST LETTER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0010 OF THE MEANS OF IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF THE SOIL FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0011 BY MECHANICAL OPERATIONS AND MINERAL AGENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0012 I HAVE NOW TO SPEAK OF THE USES AND EFFECTS OF
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0013 ANIMAL EXUVIAE AND VEGETABLE MATTERS OR MANURES PROPERLY SO CALLED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0014 IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THESE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0015 AND THE PECULIARITY OF THEIR INFLUENCE UPON OUR FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0016 IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE SOURCE WHENCE THEY ARE DERIVED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0017 IT IS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT IF WE DEPRIVE AN ANIMAL OF FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0018 THE WEIGHT OF ITS BODY DIMINISHES DURING EVERY MOMENT OF ITS EXISTENCE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0019 IF THIS ABSTINENCE IS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0020 THE DIMINUTION BECOMES APPARENT TO THE EYE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0021 ALL THE FAT OF THE BODY DISAPPEARS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0022 THE MUSCLES DECREASE IN FIRMNESS AND BULK
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0023 AND IF THE ANIMAL IS ALLOWED TO DIE STARVED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0024 SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT SKIN TENDON AND BONES REMAIN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0025 THIS EMACIATION WHICH OCCURS IN A BODY OTHERWISE HEALTHY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0026 DEMONSTRATES TO US THAT DURING THE LIFE OF AN ANIMAL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0027 EVERY PART OF ITS LIVING SUBSTANCE IS UNDERGOING A PERPETUAL CHANGE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0028 ALL ITS COMPONENT PARTS ASSUMING THE FORM OF LIFELESS COMPOUNDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0029 ARE THROWN OFF BY THE SKIN LUNGS AND URINARY SYSTEM
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0030 ALTERED MORE OR LESS BY THE SECRETORY ORGANS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0031 THIS CHANGE IN THE LIVING BODY IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0032 WITH THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION IT IS IN TRUTH
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0033 OCCASIONED BY THE OXYGEN OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN BREATHING
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0034 WHICH COMBINES WITH ALL THE VARIOUS MATTERS WITHIN THE BODY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0035 AT EVERY INSPIRATION A QUANTITY OF OXYGEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0036 PASSES INTO THE BLOOD IN THE LUNGS AND UNITES WITH ITS ELEMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0037 BUT ALTHOUGH THE WEIGHT OF THE OXYGEN THUS DAILY ENTERING INTO THE BODY AMOUNTS TO THIRTY TWO OR MORE OUNCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0038 YET THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY IS NOT THEREBY INCREASED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0039 EXACTLY AS MUCH OXYGEN AS IS IMBIBED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0040 IN INSPIRATION PASSES OFF IN EXPIRATION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0041 IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0042 SO THAT WITH EVERY BREATH
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0043 THE AMOUNT OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE BODY IS DIMINISHED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0044 BUT THE EMACIATION THE LOSS OF WEIGHT BY STARVATION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0045 DOES NOT SIMPLY DEPEND UPON THE SEPARATION OF THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0046 BUT ALL THE OTHER SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE IN COMBINATION WITH THESE ELEMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0047 IN THE LIVING TISSUES PASS OFF IN THE SECRETIONS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0048 THE NITROGEN UNDERGOES A CHANGE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0049 AND IS THROWN OUT OF THE SYSTEM BY THE KIDNEYS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0050 THEIR SECRETION THE URINE CONTAINS NOT ONLY A COMPOUND RICH IN NITROGEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0051 NAMELY UREA BUT THE SULPHUR OF THE TISSUES IN THE FORM OF A SULPHATE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0052 ALL THE SOLUBLE SALTS OF THE BLOOD AND ANIMAL FLUIDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0053 COMMON SALT THE PHOSPHATES SODA AND POTASH
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0054 THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE BLOOD OF THE MUSCULAR FIBRE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0055 AND OF ALL THE ANIMAL TISSUES WHICH CAN UNDERGO CHANGE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0056 RETURN INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THE NITROGEN AND ALL THE SOLUBLE INORGANIC ELEMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0057 ARE CARRIED TO THE EARTH IN THE URINE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0058 THESE CHANGES TAKE PLACE IN THE HEALTHY ANIMAL BODY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0059 DURING EVERY MOMENT OF LIFE A WASTE AND LOSS OF SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0060 PROCEEDS CONTINUALLY AND IF THIS LOSS IS TO BE RESTORED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0061 AND THE ORIGINAL WEIGHT AND SUBSTANCE REPAIRED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0062 AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS MUST BE FURNISHED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0063 FROM WHENCE THE BLOOD AND WASTED TISSUES MAY BE REGENERATED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0064 THIS SUPPLY IS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0065 IN AN ADULT PERSON IN A NORMAL OR HEALTHY CONDITION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0066 NO SENSIBLE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF WEIGHT OCCURS FROM DAY TO DAY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0067 IN YOUTH THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY INCREASES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0068 WHILST IN OLD AGE IT DECREASES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0069 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE ADULT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0070 THE FOOD HAS EXACTLY REPLACED THE LOSS OF SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0071 IT HAS SUPPLIED JUST SO MUCH CARBON HYDROGEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0072 NITROGEN AND OTHER ELEMENTS AS HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE SKIN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0073 LUNGS AND URINARY ORGANS IN YOUTH THE SUPPLY IS GREATER THAN THE WASTE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0074 PART OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE FOOD REMAIN TO AUGMENT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0075 THE BULK OF THE BODY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0076 IN OLD AGE THE WASTE IS GREATER THAN THE SUPPLY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0077 AND THE BODY DIMINISHES IT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0078 IS UNQUESTIONABLE THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0079 WHICH ARE SECRETED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0080 WE OBTAIN IN THE SOLID AND FLUID EXCREMENTS OF MAN AND ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0081 ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR FOOD WE OBTAIN DAILY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0082 IN THE FORM OF UREA ALL THE NITROGEN TAKEN IN THE FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0083 BOTH OF THE YOUNG AND THE ADULT AND FURTHER IN THE URINE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0084 THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE ALKALIES SOLUBLE PHOSPHATES AND SULPHATES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0085 CONTAINED IN ALL THE VARIOUS ALIMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0086 IN THE SOLID EXCREMENTS ARE FOUND ALL THOSE SUBSTANCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0087 TAKEN IN THE FOOD WHICH HAVE UNDERGONE NO ALTERATION IN THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0088 ALL INDIGESTIBLE MATTERS SUCH AS WOODY FIBRE THE GREEN COLOURING MATTER OF LEAVES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0089 CHLOROPHYLE WAX ETC PHYSIOLOGY TEACHES US THAT THE PROCESS OF NUTRITION IN ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0090 THAT IS THEIR INCREASE OF BULK OR THE RESTORATION OF WASTED PARTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0091 PROCEEDS FROM THE BLOOD THE PURPOSE OF DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0092 IS TO CONVERT THE FOOD INTO BLOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0093 IN THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES THEREFORE ALL THOSE SUBSTANCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0094 IN THE FOOD CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0095 ARE SEPARATED FROM ITS OTHER CONSTITUENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0096 IN OTHER WORDS DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE FOOD THROUGH THE INTESTINAL CANAL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0097 THERE IS A CONSTANT ABSORPTION OF ITS NITROGEN SINCE ONLY AZOTISED SUBSTANCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0098 ARE CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0099 AND THEREFORE THE SOLID EXCREMENTS ARE DESTITUTE OF THAT ELEMENT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0100 EXCEPT ONLY A SMALL PORTION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0101 IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THAT SECRETION WHICH IS FORMED TO FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0102 WITH THE SOLID EXCREMENTS THE PHOSPHATES OF LIME AND MAGNESIA
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0103 WHICH WERE CONTAINED IN THE FOOD AND NOT ASSIMILATED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0104 ARE CARRIED OFF THESE SALTS BEING INSOLUBLE IN WATER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0105 AND THEREFORE NOT ENTERING THE URINE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0106 WE MAY OBTAIN A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE SOLID EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0107 WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY COMPARING THE FAECES OF A DOG WITH HIS FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0108 WE GIVE THAT ANIMAL FLESH AND BONES SUBSTANCES RICH IN AZOTISED MATTER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0109 AND WE OBTAIN AS THE LAST PRODUCT OF ITS DIGESTION
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0110 A PERFECTLY WHITE EXCREMENT SOLID WHILE MOIST
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0111 BUT BECOMING IN DRY AIR A POWDER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0112 THIS IS THE PHOSPHATE OF LIME OF THE BONES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0113 WITH SCARCELY ONE PER CENT OF FOREIGN ORGANIC MATTER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0114 THUS WE SEE THAT IN THE SOLID AND FLUID EXCREMENTS OF MAN AND ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0115 ALL THE NITROGEN IN SHORT ALL THE CONSTITUENT INGREDIENTS OF THE CONSUMED FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0116 SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE ARE RETURNED AND AS FOOD IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM THE FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0117 WE POSSESS IN THOSE EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0118 ALL THE INGREDIENTS WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN FROM IT IN THE FORM OF SEEDS ROOTS OR HERBS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0119 ONE PART OF THE CROPS EMPLOYED FOR FATTENING SHEEP
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0120 AND CATTLE IS CONSUMED BY MAN AS ANIMAL FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0121 ANOTHER PART IS TAKEN DIRECTLY AS FLOUR POTATOES GREEN VEGETABLES ETC
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0122 A THIRD PORTION CONSISTS OF VEGETABLE REFUSE AND STRAW EMPLOYED AS LITTER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0123 NONE OF THE MATERIALS OF THE SOIL NEED BE LOST
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0124 WE CAN IT IS OBVIOUS GET BACK ALL ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0125 WHICH HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN THEREFROM AS FRUITS GRAIN AND ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0126 IN THE FLUID AND SOLID EXCREMENTS OF MAN AND THE BONES BLOOD AND SKINS OF THE SLAUGHTERED ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0127 IT DEPENDS UPON OURSELVES TO COLLECT CAREFULLY ALL THESE SCATTERED ELEMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0128 AND TO RESTORE THE DISTURBED EQUILIBRIUM OF COMPOSITION IN THE SOIL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0129 WE CAN CALCULATE EXACTLY HOW MUCH
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0130 AND WHICH OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE SOIL WE EXPORT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0131 IN A SHEEP OR AN OX IN A QUARTER OF BARLEY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0132 WHEAT OR POTATOES AND WE CAN DISCOVER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0133 FROM THE KNOWN COMPOSITION OF THE EXCREMENTS OF MAN AND ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0134 HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO SUPPLY TO RESTORE WHAT IS LOST TO OUR FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0135 IF HOWEVER WE COULD PROCURE FROM OTHER SOURCES THE SUBSTANCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0136 WHICH GIVE TO THE EXUVIAE OF MAN AND ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0137 THEIR VALUE IN AGRICULTURE WE SHOULD NOT NEED THE LATTER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0138 IT IS QUITE INDIFFERENT FOR OUR PURPOSE WHETHER WE SUPPLY THE AMMONIA
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0139 THE SOURCE OF NITROGEN IN THE FORM OF URINE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0140 OR IN THAT OF A SALT DERIVED FROM COAL TAR
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0141 WHETHER WE DERIVE THE PHOSPHATE OF LIME FROM BONES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0142 APATITE OR FOSSIL EXCREMENTS THE COPROLITHES THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEM FOR AGRICULTURE IS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0143 HOW TO REPLACE THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SOIL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0144 AND WHICH CANNOT BE FURNISHED BY THE ATMOSPHERE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0145 IF THE MANURE SUPPLIES AN IMPERFECT COMPENSATION FOR THIS LOSS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0146 THE FERTILITY OF A FIELD OR OF A COUNTRY DECREASES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0147 IF ON THE CONTRARY MORE ARE GIVEN TO THE FIELDS THEIR FERTILITY INCREASES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0148 AN IMPORTATION OF URINE OR OF SOLID EXCREMENTS FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0149 IS EQUIVALENT TO AN IMPORTATION OF GRAIN AND CATTLE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0150 IN A CERTAIN TIME THE ELEMENTS OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0151 ASSUME THE FORM OF GRAIN OR OF FODDER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0152 THEN BECOME FLESH AND BONES ENTER INTO THE HUMAN BODY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0153 AND RETURN AGAIN DAY BY DAY TO THE FORM THEY ORIGINALLY POSSESSED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0154 THE ONLY REAL LOSS OF ELEMENTS WE ARE UNABLE TO PREVENT IS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0155 OF THE PHOSPHATES AND THESE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CUSTOMS OF ALL MODERN NATIONS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0156 ARE DEPOSITED IN THE GRAVE FOR THE REST
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0157 EVERY PART OF THAT ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0158 WHICH A MAN CONSUMES DURING HIS LIFETIME
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0159 SAY IN SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS WHICH WAS DERIVED FROM THE FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0160 CAN BE OBTAINED AND RETURNED TO THEM WE KNOW WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0161 THAT IN THE BLOOD OF A YOUNG OR GROWING ANIMAL THERE REMAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF PHOSPHATE OF LIME
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0162 AND OF THE ALKALINE PHOSPHATES TO BE STORED UP
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0163 AND TO MINISTER TO THE GROWTH OF THE BONES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0164 AND GENERAL BULK OF THE BODY AND THAT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0165 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS VERY SMALL QUANTITY WE RECEIVE BACK
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0166 IN THE SOLID AND FLUID EXCREMENTS ALL THE SALTS AND ALKALINE BASES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0167 ALL THE PHOSPHATE OF LIME AND MAGNESIA AND CONSEQUENTLY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0168 ALL THE INORGANIC ELEMENTS WHICH THE ANIMAL CONSUMES IN ITS FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0169 WE CAN THUS ASCERTAIN PRECISELY THE QUANTITY QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF ANIMAL EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0170 WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF ANALYSING THEM
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0171 IF WE GIVE A HORSE DAILY FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS WEIGHT OF OATS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0172 AND FIFTEEN POUNDS OF HAY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0173 AND KNOWING THAT OATS GIVE FOUR PER CENT AND HAY NINE PER CENT OF ASHES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0174 WE CAN CALCULATE THAT THE DAILY EXCREMENTS OF THE HORSE WILL CONTAIN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0175 TWENTY ONE OUNCES OF INORGANIC MATTER WHICH WAS DRAWN FROM THE FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0176 BY ANALYSIS WE CAN DETERMINE THE EXACT RELATIVE AMOUNT OF SILICA
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0177 OF PHOSPHATES AND OF ALKALIES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0178 CONTAINED IN THE ASHES OF THE OATS AND OF THE HAY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0179 YOU WILL NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE SOLID PARTS OF ANIMAL EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0180 AND THEREFORE THEIR QUALITIES AS MANURE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0181 MUST VARY WITH THE NATURE OF THE CREATURE'S FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0182 IF WE FEED A COW UPON BEETROOT OR POTATOES WITHOUT HAY STRAW OR GRAIN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0183 THERE WILL BE NO SILICA IN HER SOLID EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0184 BUT THERE WILL BE PHOSPHATE OF LIME AND MAGNESIA
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0185 HER FLUID EXCREMENTS WILL CONTAIN CARBONATE OF POTASH AND SODA
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0186 TOGETHER WITH COMPOUNDS OF THE SAME BASES WITH INORGANIC ACIDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0187 IN ONE WORD WE HAVE IN THE FLUID EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0188 ALL THE SOLUBLE PARTS OF THE ASHES OF THE CONSUMED FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0189 AND IN THE SOLID EXCREMENTS ALL THOSE PARTS OF THE ASHES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0190 WHICH ARE INSOLUBLE IN WATER IF THE FOOD AFTER BURNING
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0191 LEAVES BEHIND ASHES CONTAINING SOLUBLE ALKALINE PHOSPHATES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0192 AS IS THE CASE WITH BREAD SEEDS OF ALL KINDS AND FLESH
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0193 WE OBTAIN FROM THE ANIMAL BY WHICH THEY ARE CONSUMED
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0194 A URINE HOLDING IN SOLUTION THESE PHOSPHATES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0195 IF HOWEVER THE ASHES OF FOOD CONTAIN NO ALKALINE PHOSPHATES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0196 BUT ABOUND IN INSOLUBLE EARTHY PHOSPHATES AS HAY CARROTS AND POTATOES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0197 THE URINE WILL BE FREE FROM ALKALINE PHOSPHATES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0198 BUT THE EARTHY PHOSPHATES WILL BE FOUND IN THE FAECES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0199 THE URINE OF MAN OF CARNIVOROUS AND GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0200 CONTAINS ALKALINE PHOSPHATES THAT OF HERBIVOROUS ANIMALS IS FREE FROM THESE SALTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0201 THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXCREMENTS OF MAN OF THE PISCIVOROUS BIRDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0202 AS THE GUANO
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0203 OF THE HORSE AND OF CATTLE FURNISHES US WITH THE PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SALTS THEY CONTAIN
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0204 AND DEMONSTRATES THAT IN THOSE EXCREMENTS WE RETURN TO THE FIELDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0205 THE ASHES OF THE PLANTS WHICH HAVE SERVED AS FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0206 THE SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE SALTS AND EARTHS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0207 INDISPENSABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTIVATED PLANTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0208 AND WHICH MUST BE FURNISHED TO THEM BY A FERTILE SOIL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0209 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IN SUPPLYING THESE EXCREMENTS TO THE SOIL
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0210 WE RETURN TO IT THOSE CONSTITUENTS WHICH THE CROPS HAVE REMOVED FROM IT
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0211 AND WE RENEW ITS CAPABILITY OF NOURISHING NEW CROPS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0212 IN ONE WORD WE RESTORE THE DISTURBED EQUILIBRIUM
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0213 AND CONSEQUENTLY KNOWING THAT THE ELEMENTS OF THE FOOD
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0214 DERIVED FROM THE SOIL ENTER INTO THE URINE AND SOLID EXCREMENTS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0215 OF THE ANIMALS IT NOURISHES WE CAN WITH THE GREATEST FACILITY
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0216 DETERMINE THE EXACT VALUE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MANURE
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0217 THUS THE EXCREMENTS OF PIGS WHICH WE HAVE FED WITH PEAS AND POTATOES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0218 ARE PRINCIPALLY SUITED FOR MANURING CROPS OF POTATOES AND PEAS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0219 IN FEEDING A COW UPON HAY AND TURNIPS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0220 WE OBTAIN A MANURE CONTAINING THE INORGANIC ELEMENTS OF GRASSES AND TURNIPS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0221 AND WHICH IS THEREFORE PREFERABLE FOR MANURING TURNIPS THE EXCREMENT OF PIGEONS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0222 CONTAINS THE MINERAL ELEMENTS OF GRAIN THAT OF RABBITS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0223 THE ELEMENTS OF HERBS AND KITCHEN VEGETABLES
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0224 THE FLUID AND SOLID EXCREMENTS OF MAN HOWEVER
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0225 CONTAIN THE MINERAL ELEMENTS OF GRAIN AND SEEDS
starlite-20070605-che/wav/che0226 IN THE GREATEST QUANTITY END OF SECTION FOURTEEN

starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0005 A SOIREE AT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0006 ON THE EVENING OF THE SEVENTEENTH MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0007 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY GAVE A FETE AT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0008 OUR READERS MUST NOT AT ONCE IMAGINE A GRAND ENTERTAINMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0009 SUCH AS A COURT BALL OR A MUSICAL SOIREE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0010 WITH A FINE ORCHESTRA CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S RECEPTION WAS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0011 YET HE HAD SPARED NO PAINS TO GIVE IT ECLAT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0012 IN FACT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0013 THE LARGE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0014 THE ROUGH WALLS CONSTRUCTED OF ROUGHLY HEWN TRUNKS OF TREES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0015 PILED UP HORIZONTALLY WERE STILL VISIBLE IT IS TRUE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0016 BUT THEIR NAKEDNESS WAS DISGUISED BY ARMS AND ARMOUR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0017 BORROWED FROM THE ARSENAL OF THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0018 AND BY AN ENGLISH TENT AT EACH CORNER OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0019 TWO LAMPS SUSPENDED BY CHAINS LIKE CHANDELIERS AND PROVIDED WITH TIN REFLECTORS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0020 RELIEVED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF THE BLACKENED BEAMS OF THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0021 AND SUFFICIENTLY ILLUMINATED THE MISTY ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0022 THE NARROW WINDOWS SOME OF THEM MERE LOOP HOLES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0023 WERE SO ENCRUSTED WITH HOAR FROST
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0024 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK THROUGH THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0025 BUT TWO OR THREE PIECES OF RED BUNTING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0026 TASTILY ARRANGED ABOUT THEM CHALLENGED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO ENTERED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0027 THE FLOOR OF ROUGH JOISTS OF WOOD LAID PARALLEL WITH EACH OTHER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0028 HAD BEEN CAREFULLY SWEPT BY CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0029 NO SOFAS CHAIRS OR OTHER MODERN FURNITURE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0030 IMPEDED THE FREE CIRCULATION OF THE GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0031 WOODEN BENCHES HALF FIXED AGAINST THE WALLS HUGE BLOCKS OF WOOD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0032 CUT WITH THE AXE AND TWO TABLES WITH CLUMSY LEGS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0033 WERE ALL THE APPLIANCES OF LUXURY THE SALOON COULD BOAST OF
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0034 BUT THE PARTITION WALL WITH A NARROW DOOR LEADING INTO THE NEXT ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0035 WAS DECORATED IN A STYLE ALIKE COSTLY AND PICTURESQUE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0036 FROM THE BEAMS HUNG MAGNIFICENT FURS ADMIRABLY ARRANGED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0037 THE EQUAL OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0038 COULD NOT BE SEEN IN THE MORE FAVOURED REGIONS OF REGENT STREET
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0039 OR THE PERSPECTIVE NEWSKI IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE FAUNA OF THE ICE BOUND NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0040 WERE HERE REPRESENTED BY THEIR FINEST SKINS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0041 THE EYE WANDERED FROM THE FURS OF WOLVES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0042 GREY BEARS POLAR BEARS OTTERS WOLVERENES BEAVERS MUSKRATS WATER POLE CATS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0043 ERMINES AND SILVER FOXES AND ABOVE THIS DISPLAY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0044 WAS AN INSCRIPTION IN BRILLIANTLY COLOURED AND ARTISTICALLY SHAPED CARDBOARD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0045 THE MOTTO OF THE WORLD FAMOUS HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY PROPELLE CUTUM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0046 REALLY CORPORAL JOLIFFE YOU HAVE SURPASSED YOURSELF SAID CAPTAIN CRAVENTY TO HIS SUBORDINATE I THINK
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0047 I HAVE I THINK I HAVE REPLIED THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0048 BUT HONOUR TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0049 DESERVES PART OF YOUR COMMENDATION SHE ASSISTED ME IN EVERYTHING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0050 A WONDERFUL WOMAN CORPORAL HER EQUAL IS NOT TO BE FOUND CAPTAIN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0051 AN IMMENSE BRICK AND EARTHENWARE STOVE OCCUPIED THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0052 WITH A HUGE IRON PIPE PASSING FROM IT THROUGH THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0053 AND CONDUCTING THE DENSE BLACK SMOKE INTO THE OUTER AIR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0054 THIS STOVE CONTAINED A ROARING FIRE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0055 CONSTANTLY FED WITH FRESH SHOVELFULS OF COAL BY THE STOKER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0056 AN OLD SOLDIER SPECIALLY APPOINTED TO THE SERVICE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0057 NOW AND THEN A GUST OF WIND DROVE BACK A VOLUME OF SMOKE INTO THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0058 DIMMING THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LAMPS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0059 AND ADDING FRESH BLACKNESS TO THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0060 WHILST TONGUES OF FLAME SHOT FORTH FROM THE STOVE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0061 BUT THE GUESTS OF FORT RELIANCE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THIS SLIGHT INCONVENIENCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0062 THE STOVE WARMED THEM AND THEY COULD NOT PAY TOO DEARLY FOR ITS CHEERING HEAT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0063 SO TERRIBLY COLD WAS IT OUTSIDE IN THE CUTTING NORTH WIND
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0064 THE STORM COULD BE HEARD RAGING WITHOUT THE SNOW FELL FAST
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0065 BECOMING RAPIDLY SOLID AND COATING THE ALREADY FROSTED WINDOW PANES WITH FRESH ICE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0066 THE WHISTLING WIND MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE CRANKS AND CHINKS OF THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0067 AND OCCASIONALLY THE RATTLING NOISE DROWNED EVERY OTHER SOUND
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0068 PRESENTLY AN AWFUL SILENCE ENSUED NATURE SEEMED TO BE TAKING BREATH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0069 BUT SUDDENLY THE SQUALL RECOMMENCED WITH TERRIFIC FURY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0070 THE HOUSE WAS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS THE PLANKS CRACKED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0071 THE BEAMS GROANED A STRANGER LESS ACCUSTOMED THAN THE HABITUES OF THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0072 TO THE WAR OF THE ELEMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0073 WOULD HAVE ASKED IF THE END OF THE WORLD WERE COME
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0074 BUT WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S GUESTS TROUBLED THEMSELVES LITTLE ABOUT THE WEATHER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0075 AND IF THEY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0076 THEY WOULD HAVE FELT NO MORE FEAR THAN THE STORMY PETRELS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0077 DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THE TEMPEST
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0078 TWO ONLY OF THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY DID NOT BELONG TO THE ORDINARY SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0079 TWO WOMEN WHOM WE SHALL INTRODUCE WHEN WE HAVE ENUMERATED CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S OTHER GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0080 THESE WERE LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON SERGEANT LONG CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0081 AND HIS BRIGHT ACTIVE CANADIAN WIFE A CERTAIN MAC NAB AND HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0082 BOTH SCOTCH JOHN RAE MARRIED TO AN INDIAN WOMAN OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0083 AND SOME SIXTY SOLDIERS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0084 THE NEIGHBOURING FORTS ALSO FURNISHED THEIR CONTINGENT OF GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0085 FOR IN THESE REMOTE LANDS PEOPLE LOOK UPON EACH OTHER AS NEIGHBOURS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0086 ALTHOUGH THEIR HOMES MAY BE A HUNDRED MILES APART
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0087 A GOOD MANY EMPLOYEES OR TRADERS CAME FROM FORT PROVIDENCE OR FORT RESOLUTION
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0088 OF THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE DISTRICT AND EVEN FROM FORT CHIPPEWAY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0089 AND FORT LIARD FURTHER SOUTH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0090 A RARE BREAK LIKE THIS IN THE MONOTONY OF THEIR SECLUDED LIVES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0091 IN THESE HYBERBOREAN REGIONS WAS JOYFULLY WELCOMED BY ALL THE EXILES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0092 AND EVEN A FEW INDIAN CHIEFS ABOUT A DOZEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0093 HAD ACCEPTED CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S INVITATION THEY WERE NOT HOWEVER ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0094 THE LUCKLESS SQUAWS BEING STILL LOOKED UPON AS LITTLE BETTER THAN SLAVES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0095 THE PRESENCE OF THESE NATIVES IS ACCOUNTED FOR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0096 BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE IN CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH THE TRADERS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0097 AND SUPPLY THE GREATER NUMBER OF FURS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0098 IN EXCHANGE FOR OTHER COMMODITIES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0099 THEY ARE MOSTLY CHIPPEWAY INDIANS WELL GROWN MEN WITH HARDY CONSTITUTIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0100 THEIR COMPLEXIONS ARE OF THE PECULIAR REDDISH BLACK COLOUR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0101 ALWAYS ASCRIBED IN EUROPE TO THE EVIL SPIRITS OF FAIRYLAND
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0102 THEY WEAR VERY PICTURESQUE CLOAKS OF SKINS AND MANTLES OF FUR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0103 WITH A HEAD DROSS OF EAGLE'S FEATHERS SPREAD OUT LIKE A LADY'S FAN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0104 AND QUIVERING WITH EVERY MOTION OF THEIR THICK BLACK HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0105 SUCH WAS THE COMPANY TO WHOM THE CAPTAIN WAS DOING THE HONOURS OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0106 THERE WAS NO DANCING FOR WANT OF MUSIC
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0107 BUT THE BUFFET ADMIRABLY SUPPLIED THE WANT OF THE HIRED MUSICIANS OF THE EUROPEAN BALLS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0108 ON THE TABLE ROSE A PYRAMIDAL PUDDING MADE BY MRS JOLIFFE'S OWN HANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0109 IT WAS AN IMMENSE TRUNCATED CONE COMPOSED OF FLOUR FAT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0110 REIN DEER VENISON AND MUSK BEEF THE EGGS MILK AND CITRON
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0111 PRESCRIBED IN RECIPE BOOKS WERE IT IS TRUE WANTING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0112 BUT THEIR ABSENCE WAS ATONED FOR BY ITS HUGE PROPORTIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0113 MRS JOLIFFE SERVED OUT SLICE AFTER SLICE WITH LIBERAL HANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0114 YET THERE REMAINED ENOUGH AND TO SPARE PILES OF SANDWICHES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0115 ALSO FIGURED ON THE TABLE IN WHICH SHIP BISCUITS TOOK THE PLACE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0116 OF THIN SLICES OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0117 AND DAINTY MORSELS OF CORNED BEEF THAT OF THE HAM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0118 AND STUFFED VEAL OF THE OLD WORLD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0119 THE SHARP TEETH OF THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0120 MADE SHORT WORK OF THE TOUGH BISCUITS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0121 AND FOR DRINK THERE WAS PLENTY OF WHISKY AND GIN HANDED ROUND IN LITTLE PEWTER POTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0122 NOT TO SPEAK OF A GREAT BOWL OF PUNCH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0123 WHICH WAS TO CLOSE THE ENTERTAINMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0124 AND OF WHICH THE INDIANS TALKED LONG AFTERWARDS IN THEIR WIGWAMS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0125 ENDLESS WERE THE COMPLIMENTS PAID TO THE JOLIFFES THAT EVENING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0126 BUT THEY DESERVED THEM HOW ZEALOUSLY THEY WAITED ON THE GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0127 WITH WHAT EASY GRACE THEY DISTRIBUTED THE REFRESHMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0128 THEY DID NOT NEED PROMPTING THEY ANTICIPATED THE WISHES OF EACH ONE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0129 THE SANDWICHES WERE SUCCEEDED BY SLICES OF THE INEXHAUSTIBLE PUDDING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0130 THE PUDDING BY GLASSES OF GIN OR WHISKY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0131 NO THANK YOU MR JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0132 YOU ARE TOO GOOD CORPORAL BUT LET ME HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0133 MRS JOLIFFE I ASSURE YOU I CAN EAT NO MORE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0134 CORPORAL JOLIFFE I AM AT YOUR MERCY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0135 NO MORE MRS JOLIFFE NO MORE THANK YOU
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0136 SUCH WERE THE REPLIES MET WITH ON EVERY SIDE BY THE ZEALOUS PAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0137 BUT THEIR POWERS OF PERSUASION WERE SUCH THAT THE MOST RELUCTANT YIELDED IN THE END
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0138 THE QUANTITIES OF FOOD AND DRINK CONSUMED WERE REALLY ENORMOUS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0139 THE HUBBUB OF CONVERSATION INCREASED THE SOLDIERY AND EMPLOYEES BECAME EXCITED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0140 HERE THE TALK WAS OF HUNTING THERE OF TRADE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0141 WHAT PLANS WERE LAID FOR NEXT SEASON
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0142 THE ENTIRE FAUNA OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0143 WOULD SCARCELY SUPPLY GAME ENOUGH FOR THESE ENTERPRISING HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0144 THEY ALREADY SAW BEARS FOXES AND MUSK OXEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0145 FALLING BENEATH THEIR BULLETS AND POLE CATS BY HUNDREDS CAUGHT IN THEIR TRAPS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0146 THEIR IMAGINATION PICTURED THE COSTLY FURS PILED UP IN THE MAGAZINES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0147 WHICH WAS THIS YEAR TO REALISE HITHERTO UNHEARD OF PROFITS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0148 AND WHILST THE SPIRITS THUS FREELY CIRCULATED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0149 INFLAMED THE IMAGINATION OF THE EUROPEANS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0150 THE LARGE DOSES OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S FIRE WATER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0151 IMBIBED BY THE INDIANS HAD AN OPPOSITE EFFECT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0152 TOO PROUD TO SHOW ADMIRATION TOO CAUTIOUS TO MAKE PROMISES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0153 THE TACITURN CHIEFS LISTENED GRAVELY AND SILENTLY TO THE BABEL OF VOICES AROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0154 THE CAPTAIN ENJOYING THE HURLY BURLY AND PLEASED TO SEE THE POOR PEOPLE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0155 BROUGHT BACK AS IT WERE TO THE CIVILISED WORLD

starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0159 WHO HAD A GRACIOUS WORD FOR EVERY BODY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0160 SOME OF THOSE EMPLOYED IN THE GARRISON AND CIVIL SERVICE OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0161 MUST HERE RECEIVE A FEW WORDS OF SPECIAL NOTICE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0162 FOR THEY WERE PRESENTLY TO GO THROUGH EXPERIENCES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0163 OF A MOST TERRIBLE NATURE WHICH NO HUMAN PERSPICACITY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FORESEEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0164 AMONGST OTHERS WE MUST NAME LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0165 CORPORAL AND MRS JOLIFFE AND THE TWO FOREIGN WOMEN ALREADY ALLUDED TO
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0166 IN WHOSE HONOUR CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S FETE WAS GIVEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0167 JASPAR HOBSON WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0168 HE WAS SHORT AND SLIGHT WITH LITTLE MUSCULAR POWER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0169 BUT A FORCE OF WILL WHICH CARRIED HIM SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH ALL TRIALS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0170 AND ENABLED HIM TO RISE SUPERIOR TO ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0171 HE WAS A CHILD OF THE COMPANY HIS FATHER MAJOR HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0172 AN IRISHMAN FROM DUBLIN WHO HAD NOW BEEN DEAD FOR SOME TIME
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0173 LIVED FOR MANY YEARS AT FORT ASSINIBOIN WITH HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0174 THERE JASPAR HOBSON WAS BORN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0175 HIS CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH WERE SPENT AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0176 HIS FATHER BROUGHT HIM UP STRICTLY AND HE BECAME A MAN IN SELF CONTROL
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0177 AND COURAGE WHILST YET A BOY IN YEARS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0178 JASPAR HOBSON WAS NO MERE HUNTER BUT A SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0179 A BRAVE AND INTELLIGENT OFFICER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0180 DURING THE STRUGGLES IN OREGON OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0181 WITH THE RIVAL COMPANIES OF THE UNION
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0182 HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY HIS ZEAL AND INTREPIDITY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0183 AND RAPIDLY ROSE TO THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0184 HIS WELL KNOWN MERIT LED TO HIS APPOINTMENT TO
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0185 THE COMMAND OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0186 THE AIM OF WHICH WAS TO EXPLORE THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0187 AND TO FOUND A FORT ON THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0188 JASPAR HOBSON WAS TO SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY EARLY IN APRIL
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0189 IF THE LIEUTENANT WAS THE TYPE OF A GOOD OFFICER SERGEANT LONG WAS THAT OF A GOOD SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0190 HE WAS A MAN OF FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0191 WITH A ROUGH BEARD THAT LOOKED AS IF IT WERE MADE OF COCOA NUT FIBRE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0192 CONSTITUTIONALLY BRAVE AND DISPOSED TO OBEY RATHER THAN TO COMMAND
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0193 HE HAD NO AMBITION BUT TO OBEY THE ORDERS HE RECEIVED NEVER QUESTIONING THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0194 HOWEVER STRANGE THEY MIGHT APPEAR NEVER REASONING FOR HIMSELF WHEN ON DUTY FOR THE COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0195 A TRUE MACHINE IN UNIFORM BUT A PERFECT MACHINE NEVER WEARING OUT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0196 EVER ON THE MARCH YET NEVER SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0197 PERHAPS SERGEANT LONG WAS RATHER HARD UPON HIS MEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0198 AS HE WAS UPON HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT TOLERATE THE SLIGHTEST INFRACTION OF DISCIPLINE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0199 AND MERCILESSLY ORDERED MEN INTO CONFINEMENT FOR THE SLIGHTEST NEGLECT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0200 WHILST HE HIMSELF HAD NEVER BEEN REPRIMANDED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0201 IN A WORD HE WAS A MAN BORN TO OBEY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0202 AND THIS SELF ANNIHILATION SUITED HIS PASSIVE TEMPERAMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0203 MEN SUCH AS HE ARE THE MATERIALS OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0204 A FORMIDABLE ARMY IS FORMED THEY ARE THE ARMS OF THE SERVICE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0205 OBEYING A SINGLE HEAD IS NOT THIS THE ONLY REALLY POWERFUL ORGANISATION
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0206 THE TWO TYPES OF FABULOUS MYTHOLOGY BRIAREUS WITH A HUNDRED ARMS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0207 AND HYDRA WITH A HUNDRED HEADS WELL REPRESENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0208 THE TWO KINDS OF ARMIES AND IN A CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0209 WHICH WOULD BE VICTORIOUS BRIAREUS WITHOUT A DOUBT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0210 WE HAVE ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0211 HE WAS THE BUSY BEE OF THE PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0212 BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TO HEAR HIM HUMMING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0213 HE WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER MAJOR DOMO THAN A SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0214 AND HE WAS HIMSELF AWARE OF THIS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0215 SO HE CALLED HIMSELF THE CORPORAL IN CHARGE OF DETAILS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0216 BUT HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIMSELF A HUNDRED TIMES
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0217 AMONGST THESE DETAILS HAD NOT LITTLE MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0218 GUIDED HIM WITH A FIRM HAND
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0219 SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0220 OBEYED HIS WIFE WITHOUT OWNING IT DOUBTLESS THINKING TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0221 LIKE THE PHILOSOPHER SANCHO A WOMAN'S ADVICE IS NO SUCH GREAT THING
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0222 BUT HE MUST BE A FOOL WHO DOES NOT LISTEN TO IT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0223 IT IS NOW TIME TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF THE TWO FOREIGN WOMEN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0224 ALREADY ALLUDED TO MORE THAN ONCE THEY WERE BOTH ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0225 AND ONE OF THEM WELL DESERVED TO TAKE FIRST RANK AMONGST CELEBRATED FEMALE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0226 THE NAME OF PAULINA BARNETT THE RIVAL OF THE PFEIFFERS TINNIS

starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0229 IN HER JOURNEYS UP THE BRAHMAPUTRA AS FAR AS THE MOUNTAINS OF TIBET
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0230 ACROSS AN UNKNOWN CORNER OF NEW HOLLAND FROM SWAN BAY TO
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0231 THE GULF OF CARPENTARIA PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0232 HAD GIVEN PROOF OF THE QUALITIES OF A GREAT TRAVELLER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0233 SHE HAD BEEN A WIDOW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0234 AND HER PASSION FOR TRAVELLING LED HER CONSTANTLY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0235 TO EXPLORE NEW LANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0236 SHE WAS TALL AND HER FACE FRAMED IN LONG BRAIDS OF HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0237 ALREADY TOUCHED WITH WHITE WAS FULL OF ENERGY SHE WAS NEAR SIGHTED
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0238 AND A DOUBLE EYE GLASS RESTED UPON HER LONG STRAIGHT NOSE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0239 WITH ITS MOBILE NOSTRILS WE MUST CONFESS THAT HER WALK
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0240 WAS SOMEWHAT MASCULINE AND HER WHOLE APPEARANCE WAS SUGGESTIVE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0241 OF MORAL POWER RATHER THAN OF FEMALE GRACE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0242 SHE WAS AN ENGLISHWOMAN FROM YORKSHIRE POSSESSED OF SOME FORTUNE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0243 THE GREATER PART OF WHICH WAS EXPENDED IN ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0244 AND SOME NEW SCHEME OF EXPLORATION HAD NOW BROUGHT HER TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0245 HAVING CROSSED THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0246 SHE WAS DOUBTLESS ANXIOUS TO PENETRATE TO THE EXTREME LIMITS OF THE HYPERBOREAN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0247 HER PRESENCE AT THE FORT WAS AN EVENT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0248 THE GOVERNOR OF THE COMPANY HAD GIVEN HER A SPECIAL LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0249 TO CAPTAIN CRAVENTY ACCORDING TO WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0250 THE LATTER WAS TO DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO FORWARD THE DESIGN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0251 OF THE CELEBRATED TRAVELLER TO REACH THE BORDERS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0252 A GRAND ENTERPRISE TO FOLLOW IN THE STEPS OF HEARNE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0253 MACKENZIE RAE FRANKLIN AND OTHERS WHAT FATIGUES WHAT TRIALS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0254 WHAT DANGERS WOULD HAVE TO BE GONE THROUGH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0255 IN THE CONFLICT WITH THE TERRIBLE ELEMENTS OF THE POLAR CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0256 HOW COULD A WOMAN DARE TO VENTURE WHERE SO MANY EXPLORERS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0257 HAVE DRAWN BACK OR PERISHED BUT THE STRANGER NOW SHUT UP
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0258 IN FORT RELIANCE WAS NO ORDINARY WOMAN SHE WAS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0259 A LAUREATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WE MUST ADD
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0260 THAT THE CELEBRATED TRAVELLER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A SERVANT NAMED MADGE
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0261 THIS FAITHFUL CREATURE WAS NOT MERELY A SERVANT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0262 BUT A DEVOTED AND COURAGEOUS FRIEND WHO LIVED ONLY FOR HER MISTRESS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0263 A SCOTCHWOMAN OF THE OLD TYPE WHOM A CALEB
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0264 MIGHT HAVE MARRIED WITHOUT LOSS OF DIGNITY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0265 MADGE WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0266 AND WAS TALL AND STRONGLY BUILT
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0267 THE TWO WERE ON THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0268 PAULINA LOOKED UPON MADGE AS AN ELDER SISTER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0269 AND MADGE TREATED PAULINA AS HER DAUGHTER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0270 IT WAS IN HONOUR OF PAULINA BARNETT THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0271 WAS THIS EVENING TREATING HIS EMPLOYEES AND THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0272 IN FACT THE LADY TRAVELLER WAS TO JOIN THE EXPEDITION
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0273 OF JASPAR HOBSON FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0274 IT WAS FOR PAULINA BARNETT THAT THE LARGE SALOON OF THE FACTORY
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0275 RESOUNDED WITH JOYFUL HURRAHS AND IT WAS NO WONDER
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0276 THAT THE STOVE CONSUMED A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF COAL
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0277 ON THIS MEMORABLE EVENING FOR THE COLD OUTSIDE WAS TWENTY FOUR DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BELOW ZERO
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0278 AND FORT RELIANCE IS SITUATED IN SIXTY DEGREES FOURTY SEVEN MINUTES NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1/wav/fur0279 LATITUDE AT LEAST FOUR DEGREES FROM THE POLAR CIRCLE

starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0005 FROM FORT RELIANCE TO FORT ENTERPRISE THE FIRST FINE DAYS CAME AT LAST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0006 THE GREEN CARPET OF THE HILLS BEGAN TO APPEAR HERE AND THERE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0007 WHERE THE SNOW HAD MELTED A FEW MIGRATORY BIRDS FROM THE SOUTH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0008 SUCH AS SWANS BALD HEADED EAGLES ETC PASSED THROUGH THE WARMER AIR
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0009 THE POPLARS BIRCHES AND WILLOWS BEGAN TO BUD
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0010 AND THE REDHEADED DUCKS OF WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY SPECIES IN NORTH AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0011 TO SKIM THE SURFACE OF THE NUMEROUS POOLS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0012 FORMED BY THE MELTED SNOW GUILLEMOTS PUFFINS AND EIDER DUCKS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0013 SOUGHT COLDER LATITUDES AND LITTLE SHREWS NO BIGGER THAN A HAZEL NUT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0014 VENTURED FROM THEIR HOLES TRACING STRANGE FIGURES ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR TINY POINTED TAILS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0015 IT WAS INTOXICATING ONCE MORE TO BREATHE THE FRESH AIR OF SPRING
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0016 AND TO BASK IN THE SUNBEAMS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0017 NATURE AWOKE ONCE MORE FROM HER HEAVY SLEEP IN THE LONG WINTER NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0018 AND SMILED AS SHE OPENED HER EYES THE RENOVATION OF CREATION IN SPRING
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0019 IS PERHAPS MORE IMPRESSIVE IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0020 THAN IN ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE GLOBE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0021 ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREATER CONTRAST WITH WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0022 THE THAW WAS NOT HOWEVER COMPLETE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0023 THE THERMOMETER IT IS TRUE MARKED FORTY ONE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT ABOVE ZERO
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0024 BUT THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE NIGHTS KEPT THE SURFACE OF THE SNOWY PLAINS SOLID
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0025 A GOOD THING FOR THE PASSAGE OF SLEDGES OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0026 JASPAR HOBSON MEANT TO AVAIL HIMSELF BEFORE THE THAW BECAME COMPLETE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0027 THE ICE OF THE LAKE WAS STILL UNBROKEN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0028 DURING THE LAST MONTH SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0029 HAD BEEN MADE ACROSS THE VAST SMOOTH PLAINS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0030 WHICH WERE ALREADY FREQUENTED BY GAME
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0031 MRS BARNETT WAS ASTONISHED AT THE SKILL WITH WHICH THE MEN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0032 USED THEIR SNOW SHOES SCUDDING ALONG AT THE PACE OF A HORSE IN FULL GALLOP
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0033 FOLLOWING CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S ADVICE THE LADY HERSELF PRACTISED WALKING IN THESE CONTRIVANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0034 AND SHE SOON BECAME VERY EXPERT IN SLIDING OVER THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0035 DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS SEVERAL BANDS OF INDIANS HAD ARRIVED AT THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0036 TO EXCHANGE THE SPOILS OF THE WINTER CHASE FOR MANUFACTURED GOODS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0037 THE SEASON HAD BEEN BAD THERE WERE A GOOD MANY POLECATS AND SABLES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0038 BUT THE FURS OF BEAVERS OTTERS LYNXES ERMINES AND FOXES WERE SCARCE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0039 IT WAS THEREFORE A WISE STEP FOR THE COMPANY TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLORE A NEW COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0040 WHERE THE WILD ANIMALS HAD HITHERTO ESCAPED THE RAPACITY OF MAN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0041 ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH APRIL LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON AND HIS PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0042 WERE READY TO START
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0043 THE ROUTE ACROSS THE KNOWN DISTRICTS BETWEEN THE SLAVE LAKE AND THAT OF THE GREAT BEAR
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0044 BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE WAS ALREADY DETERMINED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0045 JASPAR HOBSON WAS TO MAKE FOR FORT CONFIDENCE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0046 ON THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE LATTER LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0047 AND HE WAS TO REVICTUAL AT FORT ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0048 A STATION TWO HUNDRED MILES FURTHER TO THE NORTH WEST ON THE SHORES OF THE SNARE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0049 BY TRAVELLING AT THE RATE OF FIFTEEN MILES A DAY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0050 THE LIEUTENANT HOPED TO HALT THERE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF MAY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0051 FROM THIS POINT THE EXPEDITION WAS TO TAKE THE SHORTEST ROUTE TO CAPE BATHURST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0052 ON THE NORTH AMERICAN COAST IT WAS AGREED THAT IN A YEAR CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0053 SHOULD SEND A CONVOY WITH PROVISIONS TO CAPE BATHURST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0054 AND THAT A DETACHMENT OF THE LIEUTENANT'S MEN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0055 WAS TO GO TO MEET THIS CONVOY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0056 TO GUIDE IT TO THE SPOT WHERE THE NEW FORT WAS TO BE ERECTED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0057 THIS PLAN WAS A GUARANTEE AGAINST ANY ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0058 AND LEFT A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0059 OPEN TO THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS VOLUNTARY COMPANIONS IN EXILE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0060 ON THE SIXTEENTH APRIL DOGS AND SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0061 WERE AWAITING THE TRAVELLERS AT THE POSTERN GATE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0062 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY CALLED THE MEN OF THE PARTY TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0063 AND SAID A FEW KIND WORDS TO THEM
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0064 HE URGED THEM ABOVE ALL THINGS TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0065 IN THE PERILS THEY MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO MEET
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0066 REMINDED THEM THAT THE ENTERPRISE UPON WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0067 REQUIRED SELF DENIAL AND DEVOTION AND THAT SUBMISSION TO THEIR OFFICERS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0068 WAS AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF SUCCESS CHEERS GREETED THE CAPTAIN'S SPEECH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0069 THE ADIEUX WERE QUICKLY MADE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0070 AND EACH ONE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE SLEDGE ASSIGNED TO HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0071 JASPAR HOBSON AND SERGEANT LONG WENT FIRST THEN MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND MADGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0072 THE LATTER DEXTEROUSLY WIELDING THE LONG ESQUIMAUX WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0073 TERMINATING IN A STIFF THONG THOMAS BLACK AND ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0074 THE CANADIAN PETERSEN OCCUPIED THE THIRD SLEDGE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0075 CORPORAL AND MRS JOLIFFE BRINGING UP THE REAR
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0076 ACCORDING TO THE ORDERS OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON EACH DRIVER KEPT AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME DISTANCE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0077 FROM THE PRECEDING SLEDGE SO AS TO AVOID ALL CONFUSION
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0078 A NECESSARY PRECAUTION AS A COLLISION BETWEEN TWO SLEDGES GOING AT FULL SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0079 MIGHT HAVE HAD DISASTROUS RESULTS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0080 ON LEAVING FORT RELIANCE JASPAR HOBSON AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS COURSE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0081 TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0082 THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO CROSS THE LARGE RIVER CONNECTING
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0083 LAKES SLAVE AND WOLMSLEY WHICH WAS HOWEVER STILL FROZEN SO HARD
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0084 AS TO BE UNDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE VAST WHITE PLAINS AROUND
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0085 A UNIFORM CARPET OF SNOW COVERED THE WHOLE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0086 AND THE SLEDGES DRAWN BY THEIR SWIFT TEAMS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0087 SPED RAPIDLY OVER THE FIRM SMOOTH SURFACE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0088 THE WEATHER WAS FINE BUT STILL VERY COLD THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0089 SCARCE ABOVE THE HORIZON DESCRIBED A LENGTHENED CURVE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0090 AND ITS RAYS REFLECTED ON THE SNOW GAVE MORE LIGHT THAN HEAT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0091 FORTUNATELY NOT A BREATH OF AIR STIRRED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0092 AND THIS LESSENED THE SEVERITY OF THE COLD
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0093 ALTHOUGH THE RAPID PACE OF THE SLEDGES THROUGH THE KEEN ATMOSPHERE MUST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0094 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ANY ONE NOT INURED TO THE RIGOUR OF A POLAR CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0095 A GOOD BEGINNING SAID JASPAR HOBSON TO THE SERGEANT

starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0114 DURING THIS COLLOQUY BETWEEN LIEUTENANT HOBSON AND HIS SERGEANT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0115 A SLIGHT ASCENT COMPELLED THE SLEDGES TO SLACKEN SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0116 AND MRS BARNETT AND MADGE ALSO EXCHANGED A FEW SENTENCES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0117 THESE TWO INTREPID WOMEN IN THEIR OTTER SKIN CAPS AND WHITE BEAR SKIN MANTLES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0118 GAZED IN ASTONISHMENT UPON THE RUGGED SCENERY AROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0119 AND AT THE WHITE OUTLINES OF THE HUGE GLACIERS STANDING OUT AGAINST THE HORIZON
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0120 THEY HAD ALREADY LEFT BEHIND THEM THE HILLS OF THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0121 WITH THEIR SUMMITS CROWNED WITH THE GAUNT SKELETONS OF TREES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0122 THE VAST PLAINS STRETCHED BEFORE THEM IN APPARENTLY ENDLESS SUCCESSION
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0123 THE RAPID FLIGHT AND CRIES OF A FEW BIRDS OF PASSAGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0124 ALONE BROKE THE MONOTONY OF THE SCENE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0125 NOW AND THEN A TROOP OF SWANS WITH PLUMAGE SO WHITE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0126 THAT THE KEENEST SIGHT COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0127 WHEN THEY SETTLED ON THE GROUND ROSE INTO VIEW IN THE CLEAR BLUE ATMOSPHERE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0128 AND PURSUED THEIR JOURNEY TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0129 WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY EXCLAIMED MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0130 WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE POLAR REGIONS

starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0156 AND WE HAVE AS YET SEEN NONE OF THE WONDERS IT CONTAINS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0157 BUT WAIT UNTIL WE REACH THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0158 WAIT UNTIL THE WINTER SHUTS US IN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0159 WITH ITS GIGANTIC ICEBERGS AND THICK COVERING OF SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0160 WAIT TILL THE NORTHERN STORMS BREAK OVER US AND THE GLORIES OF THE AURORA BOREALIS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0161 AND OF THE SPLENDID CONSTELLATIONS OF THE POLAR SKIES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0162 ARE SPREAD OUT ABOVE OUR HEADS WAIT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0163 TILL WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE STRANGE LONG SIX MONTHS NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0164 AND THEN INDEED YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE INFINITE VARIETY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0165 THE INFINITE BEAUTY OF OUR CREATOR'S HANDIWORK THUS SPOKE MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0166 CARRIED AWAY BY HER VIVID IMAGINATION
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0167 SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTY IN THESE DESERTED REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0168 WITH THEIR RIGOROUS CLIMATE HER ENTHUSIASM GOT THE BETTER FOR THE TIME OF HER JUDGMENT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0169 HER SYMPATHY WITH NATURE ENABLED HER TO READ THE TOUCHING POETRY OF THE ICE BOUND NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0170 THE POETRY EMBODIED IN THE SAGAS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0171 AND SUNG BY THE BARDS OF THE TIME OF OSSIAN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0172 BUT MADGE MORE MATTER OF FACT THAN HER MISTRESS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0173 DISGUISED FROM HERSELF NEITHER THE DANGERS OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0174 NOR THE SUFFERINGS INVOLVED IN WINTERING ONLY THIRTY DEGREES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0175 AT THE MOST FROM THE NORTH POLE AND INDEED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0176 THE MOST ROBUST HAD SOMETIMES SUCCUMBED TO THE FATIGUES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0177 PRIVATIONS AND MENTAL AND BODILY AGONIES ENDURED IN THIS SEVERE CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0178 JASPAR HOBSON HAD NOT IT IS TRUE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0179 TO PRESS ON TO THE VERY HIGHEST LATITUDES OF THE GLOBE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0180 HE HAD NOT TO REACH THE POLE ITSELF
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0181 OR TO FOLLOW IN THE STEPS OF PARRY ROSS MCCLURE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0182 KEAN MORTON AND OTHERS BUT AFTER ONCE CROSSING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0183 THERE IS LITTLE VARIATION IN THE TEMPERATURE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0184 IT DOES NOT INCREASE IN COLDNESS IN PROPORTION TO THE ELEVATION REACHED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0185 GRANTED THAT JASPAR HOBSON DID NOT THINK OF GOING BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0186 WE MUST STILL REMEMBER THAT FRANKLIN AND HIS UNFORTUNATE COMPANIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0187 DIED OF COLD AND HUNGER BEFORE THEY HAD PENETRATED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0188 BEYOND SIXTY EIGHT DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0189 VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE TALK IN THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0190 OCCUPIED BY MR AND MRS JOLIFFE PERHAPS THE GALLANT CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0191 HAD TOO OFTEN DRUNK TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION ON STARTING
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0192 FOR STRANGE TO SAY HE WAS DISPUTING WITH HIS LITTLE WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0193 YES HE WAS ACTUALLY CONTRADICTING HER WHICH NEVER HAPPENED EXCEPT UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0194 NO MRS JOLIFFE HE WAS SAYING
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0195 NO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR A SLEDGE IS NOT MORE DIFFICULT TO GUIDE THAN A PONY CARRIAGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0196 AND THE DEVIL TAKE ME IF I CAN'T MANAGE A TEAM OF DOGS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0197 I DON'T QUESTION YOUR SKILL REPLIED MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0198 I ONLY ASK YOU NOT TO GO SO FAST
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0199 YOU ARE IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CARAVAN NOW AND I HEAR LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0200 CALLING OUT TO YOU TO RESUME YOUR PROPER PLACE BEHIND
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0201 LET HIM CALL MRS JOLIFFE LET HIM CALL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0202 AND THE CORPORAL URGING ON HIS DOGS WITH A FRESH CUT OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0203 DASHED ALONG AT STILL GREATER SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0204 TAKE CARE JOLIFFE REPEATED HIS LITTLE WIFE NOT SO FAST WE ARE GOING DOWN HILL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0205 DOWN HILL MRS JOLIFFE YOU CALL THAT DOWN HILL WHY IT'S UP HILL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0206 I TELL YOU WE ARE GOING DOWN REPEATED POOR MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0207 AND I TELL YOU WE ARE GOING UP LOOK HOW THE DOGS PULL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0208 WHOEVER WAS RIGHT THE DOGS BECAME UNEASY THE ASCENT WAS IN FACT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0209 PRETTY STEEP THE SLEDGE DASHED ALONG AT A RECKLESS PACE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0210 AND WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE OF THE REST OF THE PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0211 MR AND MRS JOLIFFE BUMPED UP AND DOWN EVERY INSTANT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0212 THE SURFACE OF THE SNOW BECAME MORE AND MORE UNEVEN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0213 AND THE PAIR FLUNG FIRST TO ONE SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0214 AND THEN TO THE OTHER KNOCKED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0215 AND WERE HORRIBLY BRUISED AND SHAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0216 BUT THE CORPORAL WOULD LISTEN NEITHER TO THE ADVICE OF HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0217 NOR TO THE SHOUTS OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0218 THE LATTER SEEING THE DANGER OF THIS RECKLESS COURSE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0219 URGED ON HIS OWN ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0220 AND THE REST OF THE CARAVAN FOLLOWED AT A RAPID PACE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0221 BUT THE CORPORAL BECAME MORE AND MORE EXCITED THE SPEED OF HIS EQUIPAGE DELIGHTED HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0222 HE SHOUTED HE GESTICULATED AND FLOURISHED HIS LONG WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0223 LIKE AN ACCOMPLISHED SPORTSMAN WONDERFUL THINGS THESE WHIPS HE CRIED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0224 THE ESQUIMAUX WIELD THEM WITH UNRIVALLED SKILL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0225 BUT YOU ARE NOT AN ESQUIMAUX CRIED MRS JOLIFFE TRYING IN VAIN TO ARREST THE ARM OF HER IMPRUDENT HUSBAND
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0226 I HAVE HEARD TELL RESUMED THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0227 I'VE HEARD TELL THAT THE ESQUIMAUX CAN TOUCH ANY DOG THEY LIKE IN ANY PART
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0228 THAT THEY CAN EVEN CUT OUT A BIT OF ONE OF THEIR EARS WITH THE STIFF THONG AT THE END OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0229 I AM GOING TO TRY DON'T TRY DON'T TRY JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0230 SCREAMED THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER WITS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0231 DON'T BE AFRAID MRS JOLIFFE DON'T BE AFRAID
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0232 I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0233 THE FIFTH DOG ON THE RIGHT IS MISBEHAVING HIMSELF
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0234 I WILL CORRECT HIM A LITTLE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0235 BUT CORPORAL JOLIFFE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT YET ENOUGH OF AN ESQUIMAUX
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0236 TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE WHIP WITH ITS THONG FOUR FEET LONGER THAN THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0237 FOR IT UNROLLED WITH AN OMINOUS HISS
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0238 AND REBOUNDING TWISTED ITSELF ROUND CORPORAL JOLIFFE'S OWN NECK
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0239 SENDING HIS FUR CAP INTO THE AIR
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0240 PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS EARS IN IT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0241 AT THIS MOMENT THE DOGS FLUNG THEMSELVES ON ONE SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0242 THE SLEDGE WAS OVERTURNED AND THE PAIR WERE FLUNG INTO THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0243 FORTUNATELY IT WAS THICK AND SOFT SO THAT THEY ESCAPED UNHURT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0244 BUT WHAT A DISGRACE FOR THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0245 HOW REPROACHFULLY HIS LITTLE WIFE LOOKED AT HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0246 AND HOW STERN WAS THE REPRIMAND OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0247 THE SLEDGE WAS PICKED UP BUT IT WAS DECIDED THAT HENCEFORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0248 THE REINS OF THE DOGS LIKE THOSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0249 WERE TO BE IN THE HANDS OF MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0250 THE CREST FALLEN CORPORAL WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0251 AND THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY WAS RESUMED NO INCIDENT WORTH MENTIONING OCCURRED
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0252 DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN DAYS THE WEATHER CONTINUED FAVOURABLE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0253 THE COLD WAS NOT TOO SEVERE
starlite-20070613-fur5/wav/fur0254 AND ON THE FIRST MAY THE EXPEDITION ARRIVED AT FORT ENTERPRISE

starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0004 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER SIX
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0005 A WAPITI DUEL TWO HUNDRED MILES HAD BEEN TRAVERSED SINCE THE EXPEDITION LEFT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0006 THE TRAVELLERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LONG TWILIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0007 PRESSED ON DAY AND NIGHT AND WERE LITERALLY OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0008 WHEN THEY REACHED FORT ENTERPRISE NEAR THE SHORES OF LAKE SNARE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0009 THIS FORT WAS NO MORE THAN A DEPOT OF PROVISIONS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0010 ERECTED A FEW YEARS BEFORE BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0011 IT SERVED AS A RESTING PLACE FOR THE MEN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0012 TAKING THE CONVOYS OF FURS FROM THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0013 SOME THREE HUNDRED MILES FURTHER TO THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0014 ABOUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS FORMED THE GARRISON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0015 THE FORT CONSISTED OF A WOODEN HOUSE SURROUNDED BY PALISADES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0016 BUT FEW AS WERE THE COMFORTS IT OFFERED LIEUTENANT HOBSON'S COMPANIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0017 GLADLY TOOK REFUGE IN IT AND RESTED THERE FOR TWO DAYS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0018 THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF THE ARCTIC SPRING WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0019 HERE AND THERE THE SNOW HAD MELTED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0020 AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NIGHTS WAS NO LONGER BELOW FREEZING POINT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0021 A FEW DELICATE MOSSES AND SLENDER GRASSES CLOTHED THE RUGGED GROUND WITH THEIR SOFT VERDURE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0022 AND FROM BETWEEN THE STONES PEEPED THE MOIST CALICES OF TINY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0023 ALMOST COLOURLESS FLOWERS THESE FAINT SIGNS OF REAWAKENING VEGETATION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0024 AFTER THE LONG NIGHT OF WINTER WERE REFRESHING TO EYES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0025 WEARY OF THE MONOTONOUS WHITENESS OF THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0026 AND THE SCATTERED SPECIMENS OF THE FLORA OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0027 WERE WELCOMED WITH DELIGHT MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0028 AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THIS LEISURE TIME TO VISIT THE SHORES OF THE LITTLE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0029 THEY WERE BOTH STUDENTS AND ENTHUSIASTIC LOVERS OF NATURE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0030 TOGETHER THEY WANDERED AMONGST THE ICE MASSES ALREADY BEGINNING TO BREAK UP
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0031 AND THE WATERFALLS CREATED BY THE ACTION OF THE RAYS OF THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0032 THE SURFACE ITSELF OF LAKE SNARE WAS STILL INTACT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0033 NOT A CRACK DENOTED THE APPROACHING THAW
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0034 BUT IT WAS STREWN WITH THE RUINS OF MIGHTY ICEBERGS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0035 WHICH ASSUMED ALL MANNER OF PICTURESQUE FORMS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0036 AND THE BEAUTY OF WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN THE LIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0037 DIFFRACTED BY THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ICE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0038 TOUCHED THEM WITH ALL MANNER OF COLOURS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0039 ONE MIGHT HAVE FANCIED THAT A RAINBOW CRUSHED IN A POWERFUL HAND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0040 BAD BEEN FLUNG UPON THE GROUND ITS FRAGMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0041 CROSSING EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0042 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SCENE EXCLAIMED MRS PAULINA BARNETT THESE PRISMATIC EFFECTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0043 VARY AT EVERY CHANGE OF OUR POSITION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0044 DOES IT NOT SEEM AS IF WE WERE BENDING OVER THE OPENING OF AN IMMENSE KALEIDOSCOPE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0045 OR ARE YOU ALREADY WEARY OF A SIGHT SO NEW AND INTERESTING TO ME
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0046 NO MADAM REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT ALTHOUGH I WAS BORN AND BRED ON THIS CONTINENT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0047 ITS BEAUTIES NEVER PALL UPON ME
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0048a BUT IF YOUR ENTHUSIASM IS SO GREAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS SCENERY WITH THE SUN SHINING UPON IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0048b WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO BEHOLD
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0049 THE TERRIBLE GRANDEUR OF THE WINTER TO OWN THE TRUTH I THINK THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0050 SO MUCH THOUGHT OF IN TEMPERATE LATITUDES SPOILS MY ARCTIC HOME
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0051 INDEED EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT SMILING AT THE LIEUTENANT'S LAST REMARK
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0052 FOR MY PART I THINK THE SUN A CAPITAL TRAVELLING COMPANION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0053 AND I SHALL NOT BE DISPOSED TO GRUMBLE AT THE WARMTH IT GIVES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0054 EVEN IN THE POLAR REGIONS AH MADAM REPLIED JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0055 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO THINK IT BEST TO VISIT RUSSIA IN THE WINTER AND THE SAHARA DESERT IN THE SUMMER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0056 YOU THEN SEE THEIR PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS TO ADVANTAGE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0057 THE SUN IS A STAR OF THE TORRID AND TEMPERATE ZONES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0058 AND IS OUT OF PLACE THIRTY DEGREES FROM THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0059 THE TRUE SKY OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE PURE FRIGID SKY OF WINTER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0060 BRIGHT WITH CONSTELLATIONS AND SOMETIMES FLUSHED WITH THE GLORY OF THE AURORA BOREALIS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0061 THIS LAND IS THE LAND OF THE NIGHT NOT OF THE DAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0062 AND YOU HAVE YET TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DELIGHTS AND MARVELS OF THE LONG POLAR NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0063 HAVE YOU EVER VISITED THE TEMPERATE ZONES OF EUROPE AND AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0064 INQUIRED MRS BARNETT YES MADAM AND I ADMIRED THEM AS THEY DESERVED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0065 BUT I RETURNED HOME WITH FRESH LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM FOR MY NATIVE LAND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0066 COLD IS MY ELEMENT AND NO MERIT IS DUE TO ME FOR BRAVING IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0067 IT HAS NO POWER OVER ME AND LIKE THE ESQUIMAUX I CAN LIVE FOR MONTHS TOGETHER IN A SNOW HUT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0068 REALLY LIEUTENANT HOBSON IT IS QUITE CHEERING TO HEAR OUR DREADED ENEMY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0069 SPOKEN OF IN SUCH TERMS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0070 I HOPE TO PROVE MYSELF WORTHY TO BE YOUR COMPANION AND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0071 WHEREVER YOU VENTURE WE WILL VENTURE TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0072 I AGREE MADAM I AGREE AND MAY ALL THE WOMEN AND SOLDIERS ACCOMPANYING ME
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0073 SHOW THEMSELVES AS RESOLUTE AS YOU IF SO GOD HELPING US
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0074 WE SHALL INDEED ADVANCE FAR YOU
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0075 HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF YET OBSERVED THE LADY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0076 NOT A SINGLE ACCIDENT HAS OCCURRED THE WEATHER HAS BEEN PROPITIOUS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0077 THE COLD NOT TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING HAS COMBINED TO AID US
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0078 YES MADAM BUT THE SUN WHICH YOU ADMIRE SO MUCH
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0079 WILL SOON CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR US AND STREW OBSTACLES IN OUR PATH
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0080 WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0081 I MEAN THAT THE HEAT WILL SOON HAVE CHANGED THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0082 THAT THE MELTED ICE WILL IMPEDE THE SLIDING OF THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0083 THAT THE GROUND WILL BECOME ROUGH AND UNEVEN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0084 THAT OUR PANTING DOGS WILL NO LONGER CARRY US ALONG WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0085 THAT THE RIVERS AND LAKES WILL RESUME THEIR LIQUID STATE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0086 AND THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO FORD OR GO ROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0087 ALL THESE CHANGES MADAM DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOLAR RAYS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0088 WILL CAUSE DELAYS FATIGUE AND DANGERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0089 THE VERY LEAST OF WHICH WILL BE THE BREAKING OF THE BRITTLE SNOW BENEATH OUR FEET
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0090 OR THE FALLING OF THE AVALANCHES FROM THE SUMMITS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0091 OF THE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0092 FOR ALL THIS WE HAVE TO THANK THE GRADUAL RISE OF THE SUN HIGHER AND HIGHER ABOVE THE HORIZON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0093 BEAR THIS IN MIND MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0094 OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE OLD CREATION ONLY ONE IS NECESSARY TO US HERE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0095 THE AIR THE OTHER THREE FIRE EARTH AND WATER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0096 ARE DE TROP IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0097 OF COURSE THE LIEUTENANT WAS EXAGGERATING AND MRS BARNETT COULD EASILY HAVE RETORTED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0098 WITH COUNTER ARGUMENTS BUT SHE LIKED TO HEAR HIS RAPTURES IN PRAISE OF HIS BELOVED COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0099 AND SHE FELT THAT HIS ENTHUSIASM WAS A GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD SHRINK FROM NO OBSTACLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0100 YET JASPAR HOBSON WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THE SUN WOULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0101 THIS WAS SEEN WHEN THE PARTY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE FOURTH MAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0102 THREE DAYS LATER THE THERMOMETER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0103 EVEN IN THE COLDEST PART OF THE NIGHT MARKED MORE THAN THIRTY TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0104 A COMPLETE THAW SET IN THE VAST WHITE SHEET OF SNOW RESOLVED ITSELF INTO WATER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0105 THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE ROCKY SOIL CAUSED CONSTANT JOLTING OF THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0106 AND THE PASSENGERS WERE ROUGHLY SHAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0107 THE ROADS WERE SO HEAVY THAT THE DOGS HAD TO GO AT A SLOW TROT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0108 AND THE REINS WERE THEREFORE AGAIN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0109 ENTRUSTED TO THE HANDS OF THE IMPRUDENT CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0110 NEITHER SHOUTS NOR FLOURISHINGS OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0111 HAD THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THE JADED ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0112 FROM TIME TO TIME THE TRAVELLERS LIGHTENED THE SLEDGES BY WALKING LITTLE WAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0113 THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION SUITED THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0114 WHO WERE NOW GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE BEST DISTRICTS FOR GAME IN THE WHOLE OF ENGLISH AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0115 MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND MADGE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE CHASE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0116 WHILST THOMAS BLACK PROFESSED ABSOLUTE INDIFFERENCE TO ALL ATHLETIC EXERCISE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0117 HE HAD NOT COME ALL THIS DISTANCE TO HUNT THE POLECAT OR THE ERMINE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0118 BUT MERELY TO LOOK AT THE MOON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0119 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HER DISC SHOULD COVER THAT OF THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0120 WHEN THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT ROSE ABOVE THE HORIZON THE IMPATIENT ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0121 WOULD GAZE AT HER WITH EAGER EYES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0122 AND ONE DAY THE LIEUTENANT SAID TO HIM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0123 IT WOULD BE A BAD LOOK OUT FOR YOU MR BLACK
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0124 IF BY ANY UNLUCKY CHANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0125 THE MOON SHOULD FAIL TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT ON THE SIXTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0126 LIEUTENANT HOBSON GRAVELY REPLIED THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0127 IF THE MOON WERE GUILTY OF SUCH A BREACH OF GOOD MANNERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0128 I SHOULD INDEED HAVE CAUSE TO COMPLAIN THE CHIEF HUNTERS OF THE EXPEDITION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0129 WERE THE SOLDIERS MARBRE AND SABINE BOTH VERY EXPERT AT THEIR BUSINESS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0130 THEIR SKILL WAS WONDERFUL AND THE CLEVEREST INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0131 WOULD NOT HAVE SURPASSED THEM IN KEENNESS OF SIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0132 PRECISION OF AIM OR MANUAL ADDRESS THEY WERE ALIKE TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0133 AND WERE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE NETS AND SNARES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0134 FOR TAKING SABLES OTTERS WOLVES FOXES BEARS ETC
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0135 NO ARTIFICE WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM AND CAPTAIN CRAVENTY HAD SHOWN HIS WISDOM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0136 IN CHOOSING TWO SUCH INTELLIGENT MEN TO ACCOMPANY THE LITTLE TROOP
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0137 WHILST ON THE MARCH HOWEVER MARBRE AND SABINE HAD NO TIME FOR SETTING TRAPS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0138 THEY COULD NOT SEPARATE FROM THE OTHERS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR OR TWO AT A TIME
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0139 AND WERE OBLIGED TO BE CONTENT WITH THE GAME WHICH PASSED WITHIN RANGE OF THEIR RIFLES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0140 STILL THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KILL TWO OF THE LARGE AMERICAN RUMINANTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0141 SELDOM MET WITH IN SUCH ELEVATED LATITUDES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0142 ON THE MORNING OF THE FIFTEENTH MAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0143 THE HUNTERS ASKED PERMISSION TO FOLLOW SOME FRESH TRACES THEY HAD FOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0144 AND THE LIEUTENANT NOT ONLY GRANTED IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0145 BUT HIMSELF ACCOMPANIED THEM WITH MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0146 AND THEY WENT SEVERAL MILES OUT OF THEIR ROUTE TOWARDS THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0147 THE IMPRESSIONS WERE EVIDENTLY THE RESULT OF THE PASSAGE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0148 OF ABOUT HALF A DOZEN LARGE DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0149 THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0150 MARBRE AND SABINE WERE POSITIVE ON THAT POINT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0151 AND COULD EVEN HAVE NAMED THE SPECIES TO WHICH THE ANIMALS BELONGED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0152 YOU SEEM SURPRISED TO HAVE MET WITH TRACES OF THESE ANIMALS HERE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0153 SAID MRS BARNETT WELL MADAM REPLIED HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0154 THIS SPECIES IS RARELY SEEN BEYOND FIFTY SEVEN DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0155 WE GENERALLY HUNT THEM AT THE SOUTH OF THE SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0156 WHERE THEY FEED UPON THE SHOOTS OF WILLOWS AND POPLARS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0157 AND CERTAIN WILD ROSES TO WHICH THEY ARE VERY PARTIAL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0158 I SUPPOSE THESE CREATURES LIKE THOSE WITH VALUABLE FURS HAVE FLED FROM THE DISTRICTS SCOURED BY THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0159 I SEE NO OTHER EXPLANATION OF THEIR PRESENCE AT SIXTY FIVE DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0160 THAT IS IF THE MEN ARE NOT MISTAKEN AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE FOOTPRINTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0161 NO NO SIR CRIED SABINE MARBRE AND I ARE NOT MISTAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0162 THESE TRACES WERE LEFT BY DEER THE DEER WE HUNTERS CALL RED DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0163 AND THE NATIVES WAPITIS HE IS QUITE RIGHT ADDED MARBRE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0164 OLD TRAPPERS LIKE US ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN IN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0165 BESIDES DON'T YOU HEAR THAT PECULIAR WHISTLING SOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0166 THE PARTY HAD NOW REACHED THE FOOT OF A LITTLE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0167 AND AS THE SNOW HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED FROM ITS SIDES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0168 THEY WERE ABLE TO CLIMB IT AND HASTENED TO THE SUMMIT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0169 THE PECULIAR WHISTLING NOTICED BY MARBRE BECOMING LOUDER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0170 MINGLED WITH CRIES RESEMBLING THE BRAYING OF AN ASS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0171 AND PROVING THAT THE TWO HUNTERS WERE RIOT MISTAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0172 ONCE AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0173 THE ADVENTURERS LOOKED EAGERLY TOWARDS THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0174 THE UNDULATING PLAINS WERE STILL WHITE WITH SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0175 BUT ITS DAZZLING SURFACE WAS HERE AND THERE RELIEVED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0176 WITH PATCHES OF STUNTED LIGHT GREEN VEGETATION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0177 A FEW GAUNT SHRUBS STRETCHED FORTH THEIR BARE AND SHRIVELLED BRANCHES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0178 AND HUGE ICEBERGS WITH PRECIPITOUS SIDES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0179 STOOD OUT AGAINST THE GREY BACKGROUND OF THE SKY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0180 WAPITIS WAPITIS THERE THEY ARE CRIED SABINE AND MARBRE AT ONCE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0181 POINTING TO A GROUP OF ANIMALS DISTINCTLY VISIBLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0182 ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE TO THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0183 WHAT ARE THEY DOING ASKED MRS BARNETT THEY ARE FIGHTING MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0184 REPLIED HOBSON THEY ALWAYS DO WHEN THE HEAT OF THE POLAR SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0185 INFLAMES THEIR BLOOD ANOTHER DEPLORABLE RESULT OF THE ACTION OF THE RADIANT ORB OF DAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0186 FROM WHERE THEY STOOD THE PARTY COULD EASILY WATCH THE GROUP OF WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0187 THEY WERE FINE SPECIMENS OF THE FAMILY OF DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0188 KNOWN UNDER THE VARIOUS NAMES OF STAGS WITH ROUNDED ANTLERS AMERICAN STAGS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0189 ROEBUCKS GREY ELKS AND RED ELKS ETC THESE GRACEFUL CREATURES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0190 HAVE SLENDER LEGS AND BROWN SKINS WITH PATCHES OF RED HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0191 THE COLOUR OF WHICH BECOMES DARKER IN THE WARMER SEASON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0192 THE FIERCE MALES ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE FEMALES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0193 BY THEIR FINE WHITE ANTLERS THE LATTER BEING ENTIRELY WITHOUT THESE ORNAMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0194 THESE WAPITIS WERE ONCE VERY NUMEROUS ALL OVER NORTH AMERICA AND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0195 THE UNITED STATES IMPORTED A GREAT MANY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0196 BUT CLEARINGS WERE BEGUN ON EVERY SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0197 THE FOREST TREES FELL BENEATH THE AXE OF THE PIONEER OF CIVILISATION AND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0198 THE WAPITIS TOOK REFUGE IN THE MORE PEACEFUL DISTRICTS OF CANADA
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0199 BUT THEY WERE SOON AGAIN DISTURBED AND WANDERED TO THE SHORES OF HUDSON'S BAY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0200 SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE WAPITI THRIVES IN A COLD COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0201 LIEUTENANT HOBSON WAS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT IT SELDOM PENETRATES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0202 BEYOND FIFTY SEVEN DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE AND THE SPECIMENS NOW FOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0203 HAD DOUBTLESS FLED BEFORE THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS WHO HUNT THEM WITHOUT MERCY
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0204 THE WAPITIS WERE SO ENGROSSED IN THEIR DESPERATE STRUGGLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0205 THAT THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE APPROACH OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0206 BUT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE CEASED FIGHTING HAD THEY BEEN AWARE OF IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0207 MARBRE AND SABINE AWARE OF THEIR PECULIARITY IN THIS RESPECT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0208 MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE ADVANCED FEARLESSLY UPON THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0209 AND HAVE TAKEN AIM AT LEISURE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0210 LIEUTENANT HOBSON SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO BEG PARDON SIR
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0211 REPLIED MARBRE BUT LET US SPARE OUR POWDER AND SHOT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0212 THESE BEASTS ARE ENGAGED IN A WAR TO THE DEATH
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0213 AND WE SHALL ARRIVE IN PLENTY OF TIME TO PICK UP THE VANQUISHED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0214 HAVE THESE WAPITIS A COMMERCIAL VALUE ASKED MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0215 YES MADAM REPLIED HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0216 AND THEIR SKIN WHICH IS NOT QUITE SO THICK AS THAT OF THE ELK
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0217 PROPERLY SO CALLED MAKES VERY VALUABLE LEATHER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0218 BY RUBBING THIS SKIN WITH THE FAT AND BRAINS OF THE ANIMAL ITSELF
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0219 IT IS RENDERED FLEXIBLE AND NEITHER DAMP NOR DRYNESS INJURES IT THE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0220 INDIANS ARE THEREFORE ALWAYS EAGER TO PROCURE THE SKINS OF THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0221 DOES NOT THE FLESH MAKE ADMIRABLE VENISON PRETTY GOOD MADAM ONLY PRETTY GOOD
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0222 IT IS TOUGH AND DOES NOT TASTE VERY NICE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0223 THE FAT BECOMES HARD DIRECTLY IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0224 AND STICKS TO THE TEETH IT IS CERTAINLY INFERIOR AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0225 TO THE FLESH OF OTHER DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0226 BUT WHEN MEAT IS SCARCE WE ARE GLAD ENOUGH TO EAT IT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0227 AND IT SUPPORTS LIFE AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0228 MRS BARNETT AND LIEUTENANT HOBSON HAD BEEN CHATTING TOGETHER FOR SOME MINUTES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0229 WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO THE WAPITIS SUDDENLY CEASED FIGHTING
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0230 WAS THEIR RAGE SATIATED OR HAD THEY PERCEIVED THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0231 AND FELT THE APPROACH OF DANGER WHATEVER THE CAUSE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0232 ALL BUT TWO FINE CREATURES FLED A TOWARDS THE EAST WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0233 IN A FEW INSTANTS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0234 AND THE SWIFTEST HORSE COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT THEM UP
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0235 MEANWHILE HOWEVER TWO MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS REMAINED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0236 HEADS DOWN ANTLERS TO ANTLERS HIND LEGS STRETCHED AND QUIVERING
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0237 THEY BUTTED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S PAUSE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0238 LIKE TWO WRESTLERS STRUGGLING FOR A PRIZE WHICH NEITHER WILL YIELD
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0239 THEY WOULD NOT SEPARATE BUT WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND TOGETHER ON THEIR FRONT LEGS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0240 AS IF RIVETED TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IMPLACABLE RAGE EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0241 YES REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT THE WAPITIS REALLY ARE MOST SPITEFUL BEASTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0242 I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE FIGHTING OUT AN OLD QUARREL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0243 WOULD NOT THIS BE THE TIME TO APPROACH THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0244 WHEN THEY ARE BLINDED WITH RAGE THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME MA'AM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0245 SAID SABINE THEY WON'T ESCAPE US NOW THEY WILL NOT STIR FROM WHERE THEY ARE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0246 WHEN WE ARE THREE STEPS FROM THEM THE RIFLES AT OUR SHOULDERS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0247 AND OUR FINGERS ON THE TRIGGERS INDEED YES MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0248 ADDED HOBSON WHO HAD CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0249 AFTER THE HUNTER'S REMARK AND WHETHER AT OUR HANDS OR FROM THE TEETH OF WOLVES
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0250 THOSE WAPITIS WILL MEET DEATH WHERE THEY NOW STAND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0251 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN LIEUTENANT SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0252 WELL GO NEARER MADAM HE REPLIED DON'T BE AFRAID OF STARTLING THE ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0253 FOR AS OUR HUNTER SAYS THEY ARE NO LONGER CAPABLE OF FLIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0254 THE FOUR NOW DESCENDED THE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0255 AND IN A FEW MINUTES GAINED THE THEATRE OF THE STRUGGLE
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0256 THE WAPITIS HAD NOT MOVED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0257 THEY WERE PUSHING AT EACH OTHER LIKE A COUPLE OF RAMS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0258 AND SEEMED TO BE INSEPARABLY GLUED TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0259 IN FACT IN THE HEAT OF THE COMBAT
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0260 THE ANTLERS OF THE TWO CREATURES HAD BECOME ENTANGLED TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0261 TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER SEPARATE WITHOUT BREAKING THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0262 THIS OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE HUNTING DISTRICTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0263 IT IS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON TO FIND ANTLERS THUS CONNECTED LYING ON THE GROUND
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0264 THE POOR ENCUMBERED ANIMALS SOON DIE OF HUNGER
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0265 OR THEY BECOME AN EASY PREY TO WILD BEASTS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0266 TWO BULLETS PUT AN END TO THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0267 AND MARBRE AND SABINE TAKING IMMEDIATE POSSESSION
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0268 CARRIED OFF THEIR SKINS TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY PREPARED
starlite-20070613-fur6/wav/fur0269 LEAVING THEIR BLEEDING CARCASSES TO BE DEVOURED BY WOLVES AND BEARS

starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0005 THE HUDSON'S BAY FUR COMPANY CAPTAIN CRAVENTY MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0006 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0007 I THINK HE IS AN OFFICER WHO WILL GO FAR WHAT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0008 DO YOU MEAN BY THE WORDS WILL GO FAR DO
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0009 YOU MEAN THAT HE WILL GO BEYOND THE TWENTY FOURTH PARALLEL
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0010 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT MRS PAULINA BARNETT'S QUESTION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0011 THEY WERE TALKING TOGETHER NEAR THE STOVE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0012 WHILST THE GUESTS WERE PASSING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THE EATING AND DRINKING TABLES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0013 MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN ALL THAT A MAN CAN DO WILL BE DONE BY JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0014 THE COMPANY HAS CHARGED HIM TO EXPLORE THE NORTH OF THEIR POSSESSIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0015 AND TO ESTABLISH A FACTORY AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0016 AND HE WILL ESTABLISH IT THAT IS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0017 SAID THE TRAVELLER IT IS MADAM BUT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0018 HAS NEVER YET DRAWN BACK FROM A TASK IMPOSED UPON HIM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0019 HOWEVER FORMIDABLE IT MAY HAVE APPEARED I CAN QUITE BELIEVE IT CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0020 REPLIED MRS BARNETT AND WE SHALL NOW SEE THE LIEUTENANT AT WORK
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0021 BUT WHAT INDUCES THE COMPANY TO CONSTRUCT A FORT ON THE SHORES OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0022 THEY HAVE A POWERFUL MOTIVE MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0023 I MAY ADD A DOUBLE MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0024 AT NO VERY DISTANT DATE RUSSIA WILL PROBABLY CEDE HER AMERICAN POSSESSIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0025 WHEN THIS CESSION HAS TAKEN PLACE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0026 THE COMPANY WILL FIND ACCESS TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0027 UNLESS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE DISCOVERED BY MCCLURE BE PRACTICABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0028 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S PROPHECY HAS SINCE BEEN REALISED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0029 FRESH EXPLORATIONS WILL DECIDE THIS FOR
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0030 THE ADMIRALTY IS ABOUT TO SEND A VESSEL
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0031 WHICH WILL COAST ALONG THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0032 FROM BEHRING STRAIT TO CORONATION GULF ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF WHICH
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0033 THE NEW ART IS TO BE ESTABLISHED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0034 IF THE ENTERPRISE SUCCEED THIS POINT WILL BECOME AN IMPORTANT FACTORY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0035 THE CENTRE OF THE NORTHERN FUR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0036 THE TRANSPORT OF FURS ACROSS THE INDIAN TERRITORIES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0037 INVOLVES A VAST EXPENDITURE OF TIME AND MONEY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0038 WHEREAS IF THE NEW ROUTE BE AVAILABLE STEAMERS WILL TAKE THEM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0039 FROM THE NEW FORT TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN A FEW DAYS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0040 THAT WOULD INDEED BE AN IMPORTANT RESULT OF THE ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0041 IF THIS NORTH WEST PASSAGE CAN REALLY BE USED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0042 REPLIED MRS PAULINA BARNETT BUT I THINK YOU SPOKE OF A DOUBLE MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0043 I DID MADAM SAID THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0044 AND I ALLUDED TO A MATTER OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0045 BUT I MUST BEG OF YOU
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0046 TO ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IN A FEW WORDS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0047 HOW THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS CAME ABOUT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0048 HOW IT IS IN FACT THAT THE VERY SOURCE OF THE TRADE OF THIS ONCE FLOURISHING COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0049 IS IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0050 THE CAPTAIN THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE FAMOUS HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0051 IN THE EARLIEST TIMES MEN EMPLOYED THE SKINS AND FURS OF ANIMALS AS CLOTHING
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0052 THE FUR TRADE IS THEREFORE OF VERY GREAT ANTIQUITY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0053 LUXURY IN DRESS INCREASED TO SUCH AN EXTENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0054 THAT SUMPTUARY LAWS WERE ENACTED TO CONTROL TOO GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0055 ESPECIALLY IN FURS FOR WHICH THERE WAS A POSITIVE PASSION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0056 VAIR AND THE FURS OF SIBERIAN SQUIRRELS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0057 WERE PROHIBITED AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0058 IN FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE RUSSIA FOUNDED SEVERAL ESTABLISHMENTS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0059 IN THE NORTHERN STEPPES AND ENGLAND LOST NO TIME IN FOLLOWING HER EXAMPLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0060 THE TRADE IN SABLES ERMINES AND BEAVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0061 WAS CARRIED ON THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE SAMOYEDES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0062 BUT DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH A ROYAL DECREE RESTRICTED THE USE OF COSTLY FURS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0063 THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS THIS BRANCH OF INDUSTRY WAS COMPLETELY PARALYSED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0064 ON THE SECOND MAY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0065 SIXTEEN SEVENTY A LICENCE TO TRADE IN FURS IN THE HUDSON'S BAY TERRITORY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0066 WAS GRANTED TO THE COMPANY WHICH NUMBERED SEVERAL MEN OF HIGH RANK AMONGST ITS SHAREHOLDERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0067 THE DUKE OF YORK THE DUKE OF ALBEMARLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0068 THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY AND COMPANY ITS CAPITAL WAS THEN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0069 ONLY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0070 PRIVATE COMPANIES WERE FORMIDABLE RIVALS TO ITS SUCCESS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0071 AND FRENCH AGENTS MAKING CANADA THEIR HEADQUARTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0072 VENTURED ON HAZARDOUS BUT MOST LUCRATIVE EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0073 THE ACTIVE COMPETITION OF THESE BOLD HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0074 THREATENED THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE INFANT COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0075 THE CONQUEST OF CANADA HOWEVER SOMEWHAT LESSENED THE DANGER OF ITS POSITION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0076 THREE YEARS AFTER THE TAKING OF QUEBEC SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0077 THE FUR TRADE RECEIVED A NEW IMPULSE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0078 ENGLISH TRADERS BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRADE OF THIS KIND
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0079 THEY LEARNED THE CUSTOMS OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0080 THE WAYS OF THE INDIANS AND THEIR SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE OF GOODS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0081 BUT FOR ALL THIS THE COMPANY AS YET MADE NO PROFITS WHATEVER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0082 MOREOVER TOWARDS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SOME MERCHANTS OF MONTREAL
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0083 COMBINED TO EXPLORE THE FUR COUNTRY AND FOUNDED THAT POWERFUL NORTH WEST COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0084 WHICH SOON BECAME THE CENTRE OF THE FUR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0085 IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0086 THE NEW COMPANY SHIPPED FURS TO THE VALUE OF NO LESS THAN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0087 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0088 AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WAS AGAIN THREATENED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0089 WE MUST ADD THAT THE NORTH WEST COMPANY SHRANK FROM NO ACT HOWEVER INIQUITOUS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0090 IF ITS INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE ITS AGENTS IMPOSED ON THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0091 SPECULATED ON THE MISERY OF THE INDIANS ROBBED THEM WHEN THEY HAD THEMSELVES MADE THEM DRUNK
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0092 SETTING AT DEFIANCE THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT FORBIDDING THE SALE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0093 OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS ON INDIAN TERRITORY AND CONSEQUENTLY REALISING IMMENSE PROFITS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0094 IN SPITE OF THE COMPETITION OF THE VARIOUS RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN COMPANIES WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0095 THE AMERICAN FUR COMPANY AMONGST OTHERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0096 FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN OH NINE WITH A CAPITAL OF A MILLION OF DOLLARS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0097 WHICH WAS CARRYING ON OPERATIONS ON THE WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0098 THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WAS PROBABLY IN GREATER DANGER OF RUIN THAN ANY OTHER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0099 BUT IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0100 A TREATY WAS MADE IN ACCORDANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0101 WITH WHICH ITS OLD RIVAL THE NORTH WEST COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0102 BECAME AMALGAMATED WITH IT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0103 THE TWO RECEIVING THE COMMON TITLE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY FUR COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0104 NOW THE ONLY RIVAL OF THIS IMPORTANT ASSOCIATION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0105 IS THE AMERICAN ST LOUIS FUR COMPANY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0106 HAS NUMEROUS ESTABLISHMENTS SCATTERED OVER A DOMAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0107 EXTENDING OVER THREE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0108 ITS PRINCIPAL FACTORIES ARE SITUATED ON JAMES BAY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0109 AT THE MOUTH OF THE SEVERN IN THE SOUTH
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0110 AND TOWARDS THE FRONTIERS OF UPPER CANADA ON LAKES ATHAPESKOW
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0111 WINNIPEG SUPERIOR METHYE BUFFALO AND NEAR THE COLOMBIA MACKENZIE SASKATCHEWAN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0112 AND ASSINIBOIN RIVERS AND COMPANY FORT YORK
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0113 COMMANDING THE COURSE OF THE RIVER NELSON
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0114 IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMPANY AND CONTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL FUR DEPOT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0115 MOREOVER IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO IT TOOK A LEASE OF ALL THE RUSSIAN ESTABLISHMENTS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0116 IN NORTH AMERICA AT AN ANNUAL RENT OF FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0117 SO THAT IT IS NOW WORKING ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0118 THE VAST TRACTS OF COUNTRY BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0119 IT HAS SENT OUT INTREPID EXPLORERS IN EVERY DIRECTION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0120 HEARNE TOWARDS THE POLAR SEA IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0121 TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE COPPERMINE RIVER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0122 FRANKLIN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0123 ALONG FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0124 OF THE AMERICAN COAST MACKENZIE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0125 WHO AFTER HAVING DISCOVERED THE RIVER TO WHICH HE GAVE HIS NAME
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0126 REACHED THE SHORES OF THE PACIFIC
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0127 AT FIFTY TWO DEGREES TWENTY FOUR MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0128 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE QUANTITIES OF SKINS AND FURS DESPATCHED TO EUROPE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0129 BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0130 WHICH WILL GIVE AN EXACT IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF ITS TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0131 BEAVERS ONE THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FOUR SKINS AND YOUNG BEAVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0132 NINETY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MUSK RATS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0133 SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND AND NINETY TWO BADGERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0134 ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTY NINE BEARS SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0135 ERMINES FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE FOES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0136 NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN LYNXES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0137 FOURTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE SABLES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0138 SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY POLECATS

starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0140 RACOONS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN SWANS SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0141 WOLVES EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR WOLVERINES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0142 ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0143 SUCH FIGURES OUGHT TO BRING IN A LARGE PROFIT TO THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0144 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MAINTAINED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0145 AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE BEEN DECREASING
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0146 THE CAUSE OF THIS DECLINE WAS THE SUBJECT OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S EXPLANATION TO MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0147 UNTIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE MADAM SAID HE THE COMPANY WAS IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0148 IN THAT YEAR THE NUMBER OF FURS EXPORTED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0149 WAS TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0150 BUT SINCE THEN THE TRADE HAS GRADUALLY DECLINED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0151 AND THIS NUMBER IS NOW REDUCED BY ONE HALF AT LEAST
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0152 BUT WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS THE CAUSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY DECREASE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0153 IN THE EXPORTATION OF FURS INQUIRED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0154 THE DEPOPULATION OF THE HUNTING TERRITORIES CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0155 AND I MUST ADD THE WANT OF FORESIGHT OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0156 THE GAME WAS TRAPPED AND KILLED WITHOUT MERCY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0157 THESE MASSACRES WERE CONDUCTED IN THE MOST RECKLESS AND SHORT SIGHTED FASHION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0158 EVEN FEMALES WITH YOUNG AND THEIR LITTLE ONES DID NOT ESCAPE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0159 THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE ANIMALS WHOSE FUR IS VALUABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0160 HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY RARE THE OTTER HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0161 AND IS ONLY TO BE FOUND NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0162 SMALL COLONIES OF BEAVERS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE ON THE SHORES OF THE MOST DISTANT RIVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0163 IT IS THE SAME WITH MANY OTHER ANIMALS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0164 COMPELLED TO FLEE BEFORE THE INVASION OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0165 THE TRAPS ONCE CROWDED WITH GAME ARE NOW EMPTY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0166 THE PRICE OF SKINS IS RISING JUST WHEN A GREAT DEMAND EXISTS FOR FURS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0167 HUNTERS HAVE GONE AWAY IN DISGUST LEAVING NONE BUT THE MOST INTREPID AND INDEFATIGABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0168 WHO NOW PENETRATE TO THE VERY CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0169 YES SAID MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0170 THE FACT OF THE FUR BEARING ANIMALS HAVING TAKEN REFUGE BEYOND THE POLAR CIRCLE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0171 IS A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION OF THE COMPANY'S MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0172 IN FOUNDING A FACTORY ON THE BORDERS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0173 NOT ONLY SO MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN THE COMPANY IS ALSO COMPELLED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0174 TO SEEK A MORE NORTHERN CENTRE OF OPERATIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0175 FOR AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT HAS LATELY GREATLY REDUCED ITS DOMAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0176 AND THE MOTIVE FOR THIS REDUCTION INQUIRED THE TRAVELLER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0177 A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WAS INVOLVED MADAM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0178 ONE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL GREATLY TO INTEREST THE STATESMEN OF GREAT BRITAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0179 IN A WORD THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND THOSE OF CIVILISATION ARE ANTAGONISTIC
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0180 IT IS TO THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0181 TO KEEP THE TERRITORY BELONGING TO IT IN A WILD UNCULTIVATED CONDITION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0182 EVERY ATTEMPT AT CLEARING GROUND
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0183 WAS PITILESSLY PUT A STOP TO AS IT DROVE AWAY THE WILD ANIMALS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0184 SO THAT THE MONOPOLY ENJOYED BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0185 WAS DETRIMENTAL TO ALL AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0186 ALL QUESTIONS NOT IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THEIR OWN PARTICULAR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0187 WERE RELENTLESSLY PUT ASIDE BY THE GOVERNORS OF THE ASSOCIATION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0188 IT WAS THIS DESPOTIC AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE IMMORAL SYSTEM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0189 WHICH PROVOKED THE MEASURES TAKEN BY PARLIAMENT
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0190 AND IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE COLONIAL SECRETARY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0191 DECIDED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ANNEX TO CANADA
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0192 ALL THE TERRITORIES SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0193 SUCH AS THE RED RIVER AND SASKATCHEWAN DISTRICTS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0194 AND TO LEAVE TO THE COMPANY ONLY THAT PORTION OF ITS LAND
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0195 WHICH APPEARED TO BE INCAPABLE OF FUTURE CIVILISATION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0196 THE NEXT YEAR THE COMPANY LOST THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0197 WHICH IT HELD DIRECT FROM THE COLONIAL OFFICE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0198 AND YOU WILL NOW UNDERSTAND MADAM HOW THE AGENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVING LOST THEIR POWER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0199 OVER THEIR OLD TERRITORIES ARE DETERMINED BEFORE GIVING UP THEIR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0200 TO TRY TO WORK THE LITTLE KNOWN COUNTRIES OF THE NORTH
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0201 AND SO OPEN A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PACIFIC BY MEANS OF THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0202 MRS PAULINA BARNETT WAS NOW WELL INFORMED AS TO THE ULTERIOR PROJECTS OF THE CELEBRATED COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0203 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY HAD GIVEN HER A GRAPHIC SKETCH OF THE SITUATION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0204 AND IT IS PROBABLE HE WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO FURTHER DETAILS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0205 HAD NOT AN INCIDENT CUT SHORT HIS HARANGUE CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0206 ANNOUNCED IN A LOUD VOICE THAT WITH MRS JOLIFFE'S ASSISTANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0207 HE WAS ABOUT TO MIX THE PUNCH
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0208 THIS NEWS WAS RECEIVED AS IT DESERVED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0209 THE BOWL OR RATHER THE BASIN WAS FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS LIQUID
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0210 IT CONTAINED NO LESS THAN TEN PINTS OF COARSE RUM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0211 SUGAR MEASURED OUT BY MRS JOLIFFE WAS PILED UP AT THE BOTTOM
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0212 AND ON THE TOP FLOATED SLICES OF LEMON SHRIVELLED WITH AGE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0213 NOTHING REMAINED TO BE DONE BUT TO LIGHT THIS ALCOHOLIC LAKE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0214 AND THE CORPORAL MATCH IN HAND AWAITED THE ORDER OF HIS CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0215 AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO SPRING A MINE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0216 ALL RIGHT JOLIFFE AT LAST SAID CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0217 THE LIGHT WAS APPLIED TO THE BOWL
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0218 AND IN A MOMENT THE PUNCH WAS IN FLAMES
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0219 WHILST THE GUESTS APPLAUDED AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0220 TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS FULL GLASSES OF THE DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0221 WERE CIRCULATING AMONGST THE GUESTS FRESH BIDDERS FOR THEM COMING FORWARD IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0222 LIKE SPECULATORS ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE HURRAH HURRAH HURRAH
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0223 THREE CHEERS FOR MRS BARNETT A CHEER FOR THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0224 IN THE MIDST OF THESE JOYFUL SHOUTS CRIES WERE HEARD FROM OUTSIDE
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0225 SILENCE IMMEDIATELY FELL UPON THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0226 SAID THE CAPTAIN GO AND SEE WHAT IS THE MATTER
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0227 AND AT HIS CHIEF'S ORDER THE SERGEANT LEAVING HIS GLASS UNFINISHED
starlite-20070614-fur2/wav/fur0228 LEFT THE ROOM END OF CHAPTER TWO

starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0004 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER THREE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0005 A SAVANT THAWED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0006 SERGEANT LONG HASTENED TO THE NARROW PASSAGE FROM WHICH OPENED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0007 AND HE HEARD THE CRIES REDOUBLED AND COMBINED WITH VIOLENT BLOWS ON THE POSTERN GATE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0008 SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS WHICH GAVE ACCESS TO THE COURT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0009 THE SERGEANT PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0010 AND PLUNGING INTO THE SNOW ALREADY A FOOT DEEP
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0011 HE WADED THROUGH IT ALTHOUGH HALF BLINDED BY THE CUTTING SLEET
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0012 AND NIPPED BY THE TERRIBLE COLD
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0013 WHAT THE DEVIL DOES ANY ONE WANT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT EXCLAIMED THE SERGEANT TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0014 AS HE MECHANICALLY REMOVED THE HEAVY BARS OF THE GATE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0015 NONE BUT ESQUIMAUX WOULD DARE TO BRAVE SUCH A TEMPERATURE AS THIS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0016 OPEN OPEN OPEN THEY SHOUTED FROM WITHOUT I AM OPENING REPLIED SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0017 WHO REALLY SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME ABOUT IT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0018 AT LAST THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0019 AND THE SERGEANT WAS ALMOST UPSET BY A SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0020 DRAWN BY SIX DOGS WHICH DASHED PAST HIM LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0021 WORTHY SERGEANT LONG ONLY JUST ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0022 BUT HE GOT UP WITHOUT A MURMUR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0023 CLOSED THE GATE AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AT HIS ORDINARY PACE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0024 THAT IS TO SAY AT THE RATE OF SEVENTY FIVE STRIDES A MINUTE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0025 BUT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON AND CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0026 WERE ALREADY OUTSIDE BRAVING THE INTENSE COLD AND STARING AT THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0027 WHITE WITH SNOW WHICH HAD JUST DRAWN UP IN FRONT OF THEM
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0028 A MAN COMPLETELY ENVELOPED IN FURS NOW DESCENDED FROM IT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0029 FORT RELIANCE HE INQUIRED THE SAME REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0030 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY BEHOLD HIM WHO ARE YOU A COURIER OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0031 ARE YOU ALONE NO I BRING A TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0032 A TRAVELLER AND WHAT DOES HE WANT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0033 HE IS COME TO SEE THE MOON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0034 AT THIS REPLY CAPTAIN CRAVENTY SAID TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0035 THE MAN MUST BE A FOOL
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0036 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO ANNOUNCE THIS OPINION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0037 FOR THE COURIER HAD TAKEN AN INERT MASS FROM THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0038 A KIND OF BAG COVERED WITH SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0039 AND WAS ABOUT TO CARRY IT INTO THE HOUSE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0040 WHEN THE CAPTAIN INQUIRED WHAT IS THAT BAG IT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0041 IS MY TRAVELLER REPLIED THE COURIER WHO IS THIS TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0042 THE ASTRONOMER THOMAS BLACK BUT HE IS FROZEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0043 WELL HE MUST BE THAWED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0044 THOMAS BLACK CARRIED BY THE SERGEANT THE CORPORAL AND THE COURIER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0045 NOW MADE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0046 AND WAS TAKEN TO A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0047 THE TEMPERATURE OF WHICH WAS BEARABLE THANKS TO A GLOWING STOVE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0048 HE WAS LAID UPON A BED AND THE CAPTAIN TOOK HIS HAND
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0049 IT WAS LITERALLY FROZEN THE WRAPPERS AND FURRED MANTLES IN WHICH THOMAS BLACK WAS ROLLED UP
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0050 LIKE A PARCEL REQUIRING CARE WERE REMOVED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0051 AND REVEALED A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0052 HE WAS SHORT AND STOUT HIS HAIR WAS ALREADY TOUCHED WITH GREY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0053 HIS BEARD WAS UNTRIMMED HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0054 AND HIS LIPS PRESSED TOGETHER AS IF GLUED TO ONE ANOTHER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0055 IF HE BREATHED AT ALL IT WAS SO SLIGHTLY THAT THE FROST WORK ON THE WINDOWS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0056 WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IT JOLIFFE UNDRESSED HIM
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0057 AND TURNED HIM RAPIDLY ON TO HIS FACE AND BACK AGAIN WITH THE WORDS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0058 COME COME SIR WHEN DO YOU MEAN TO RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0059 BUT THE VISITOR WHO HAD ARRIVED IN SO STRANGE A MANNER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0060 SHOWED NO SIGNS OF RETURNING LIFE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0061 AND CORPORAL JOLIFFE COULD THINK OF NO BETTER MEANS TO RESTORE THE LOST VITAL HEAT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0062 THAN TO GIVE HIM A BATH IN THE BOWL OF HOT PUNCH
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0063 VERY HAPPILY FOR THOMAS BLACK HOWEVER LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON HAD ANOTHER IDEA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0064 SNOW BRING SNOW HE CRIED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0065 THERE WAS PLENTY OF IT IN THE COURT OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0066 AND WHILST THE SERGEANT WENT TO FETCH THE SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0067 JOLIFFE REMOVED ALL THE ASTRONOMER'S CLOTHES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0068 THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS COVERED WITH WHITE FROST BITTEN PATCHES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0069 IT WAS URGENTLY NECESSARY TO RESTORE THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IN THE AFFECTED PORTIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0070 THIS RESULT JASPAR HOBSON HOPED TO OBTAIN BY VIGOROUS FRICTION WITH THE SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0071 WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANS GENERALLY EMPLOYED IN THE POLAR COUNTRIES TO SET GOING AFRESH THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD ARRESTED BY THE INTENSE COLD
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0072 EVEN AS THE RIVERS ARE ARRESTED IN THEIR COURSES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0073 BY THE ICY TOUCH OF WINTER SERGEANT LOIN SOON RETURNED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0074 AND HE AND JOLIFFE GAVE THE NEW ARRIVAL SUCH A RUBBING
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0075 AS HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE RECEIVED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0076 IT WAS NO SOFT AND AGREEABLE FRICTION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0077 BUT A VIGOROUS SHAMPOOING MOST LUSTILY PERFORMED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0078 MORE LIKE THE SCRATCHING OF A CURRY COMB
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0079 THAN THE CARESSES OF A HUMAN HAND AND DURING THE OPERATION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0080 THE LOQUACIOUS CORPORAL CONTINUED TO EXHORT THE UNCONSCIOUS TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0081 COME COME SIR WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GETTING FROZEN LIKE THIS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0082 NOW DON'T BE SO OBSTINATE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0083 PROBABLY IT WAS OBSTINACY WHICH KEPT THOMAS BLACK FROM DEIGNING TO SHOW A SIGN OF LIFE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0084 AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR THE RUBBERS BEGAN TO DESPAIR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0085 AND WERE ABOUT TO DISCONTINUE THEIR EXHAUSTING EFFORTS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0086 WHEN THE POOR MAN SIGHED SEVERAL TIMES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0087 HE LIVES HE IS COMING TO CRIED JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0088 AFTER HAVING WARMED THE OUTSIDE OF HIS BODY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0089 CORPORAL JOLIFFE HURRIED TO DO THE SAME FOR THE INSIDE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0090 AND HASTILY FETCHED A FEW GLASSES OF THE PUNCH
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0091 THE TRAVELLER REALLY FELT MUCH REVIVED BY THEM
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0092 THE COLOUR RETURNED TO HIS CHEEKS EXPRESSION TO HIS EYES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0093 AND WORDS TO HIS LIPS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0094 SO THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AN EXPLANATION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0095 FROM THOMAS BLACK HIMSELF OF HIS STRANGE ARRIVAL AT THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0096 IN SUCH A TERRIBLE CONDITION AT LAST THE TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0097 WELL COVERED WITH WRAPS ROSE ON HIS ELBOW AND SAID IN A VOICE STILL FAINT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0098 FORT RELIANCE THE SAME REPLIED THE CAPTAIN CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0099 HE IS BEFORE YOU AND IS HAPPY TO BID YOU WELCOME
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0100 BUT MAY I INQUIRE WHAT BRINGS YOU TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0101 HE IS COME TO SEE THE MOON REPLIED THE COURIER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0102 WHO EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THIS A HAPPY ANSWER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0103 IT SATISFIED THOMAS BLACK TOO FOR HE BENT HIS HEAD IN ASSENT AND RESUMED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0104 LIEUTENANT HOBSON I AM HERE REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0105 YOU HAVE NOT YET STARTED NOT YET SIR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0106 THEN REPLIED THOMAS BLACK I HAVE ONLY TO THANK YOU
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0107 AND TO GO TO SLEEP UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0108 THE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS RETIRED LEAVING THEIR STRANGE VISITOR TO HIS REPOSE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0109 HALF AN HOUR LATER THE FETE WAS AT AN END
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0110 AND THE GUESTS HAD REGAINED THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0111 EITHER IN THE DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0112 OR THE SCATTERED HOUSES OUTSIDE THE ENCEINTE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0113 THE NEXT DAY THOMAS BLACK WAS RATHER BETTER HIS VIGOROUS CONSTITUTION HAD THROWN OFF THE EFFECTS OF THE TERRIBLE CHILL HE HAD HAD
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0114 ANY ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE DIED FROM IT BUT HE WAS NOT LIKE OTHER MEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0115 AND NOW WHO WAS THIS ASTRONOMER WHERE DID HE COME FROM
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0116 WHY HAD HE UNDERTAKEN THIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE TERRITORIES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0117 IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER WHAT DID THE COURIER'S REPLY SIGNIFY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0118 TO SEE THE MOON THE MOON COULD BE SEEN ANYWHERE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0119 THERE WAS NO NEED TO COME TO THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS TO LOOK AT IT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0120 SUCH WERE THE THOUGHTS WHICH PASSED THROUGH CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S MIND
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0121 BUT THE NEXT DAY AFTER AN HOUR'S TALK WITH HIS NEW GUEST
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0122 HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WISHED TO KNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0123 THOMAS BLACK WAS AN ASTRONOMER ATTACHED TO THE GREENWICH OBSERVATORY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0124 SO BRILLIANTLY PRESIDED OVER BY PROFESSOR AIRY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0125 MR BLACK WAS NO THEORIST BUT A SAGACIOUS AND INTELLIGENT OBSERVER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0126 AND IN THE TWENTY YEARS DURING WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF TO ASTRONOMY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0127 HE HAD RENDERED GREAT SERVICES TO THE SCIENCE OF OURANOGRAPHY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0128 IN PRIVATE LIFE HE WAS A SIMPLE NONENTITY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0129 HE EXISTED ONLY FOR ASTRONOMY HE LIVED IN THE HEAVENS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0130 NOT UPON THE EARTH AND WAS A TRUE DESCENDANT OF THE WITTY LA FONTAINE'S SAVANT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0131 WHO FELL INTO A WELL HE COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT STARS AND CONSTELLATIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0132 HE OUGHT TO HAVE LIVED IN A TELESCOPE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0133 AS AN OBSERVER BE HAD NOT HIS RIVAL
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0134 HIS PATIENCE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE HE COULD WATCH FOR MONTHS FOR A COSMICAL PHENOMENON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0135 HE HAD A SPECIALTY OF HIS OWN TOO HE HAD STUDIED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0136 LUMINOUS METEORS AND SHOOTING STARS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0137 AND HIS DISCOVERIES IN THIS BRANCH OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE WERE CONSIDERABLE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0138 WHEN EVER MINUTE OBSERVATIONS OR EXACT MEASUREMENTS AND DEFINITIONS WERE REQUIRED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0139 THOMAS BLACK WAS CHOSEN FOR THE SERVICE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0140 FOR HIS CLEARNESS OF SIGHT WAS SOMETHING REMARKABLE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0141 THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IS NOT GIVEN TO EVERYONE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0142 AND IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE SURPRISING THAT THE GREENWICH ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0143 SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE MISSION WE ARE ABOUT TO DESCRIBE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0144 WHICH INVOLVED RESULTS SO INTERESTING FOR SELENOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0145 WE KNOW THAT DURING A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0146 THE MOON IS SURROUNDED BY A LUMINOUS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0147 BUT WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0148 IS IT A REAL SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0149 OR IS IT ONLY AN EFFECT OF THE DIFFRACTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS NEAR THE MOON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0150 THIS IS A QUESTION WHICH SCIENCE HAS HITHERTO BEEN UNABLE TO ANSWER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0151 AS EARLY AS SEVENTEEN OH SIX THIS LUMINOUS HALO WAS SCIENTIFICALLY DESCRIBED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0152 THE CORONA WAS MINUTELY EXAMINED DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0153 BY LONVILLE AND HALLEY BY MARALDI IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0154 BY ANTONIO DE'ULLOA IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0155 BY BONDITCH AND FERRER IN EIGHTEEN OH SIX
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0156 BUT THEIR THEORIES WERE SO CONTRADICTORY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0157 THAT NO DEFINITE CONCLUSION COULD BE ARRIVED AT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0158 DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0159 LEARNED MEN OF ALL NATIONS AIRY ARAGO KEYTAL LANGIER MAUVAIS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0160 OTTO STRUVE PETIT BAILY ETC
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0161 ENDEAVOURED TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PHENOMENON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0162 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE DISAGREEMENT SAYS ARAGO
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0163 OF THE OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN DIFFERENT PLACES BY SKILFUL ASTRONOMERS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0164 OF ONE AND THE SAME ECLIPSE HAVE INVOLVED THE QUESTION IN FRESH OBSCURITY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0165 SO THAT IT IS NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY CERTAIN CONCLUSION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0166 AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENON SINCE THIS WAS WRITTEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0167 OTHER TOTAL ECLIPSES HAVE BEEN STUDIED WITH NO BETTER RESULTS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0168 YET THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0169 IS OF SUCH VAST IMPORTANCE TO SELENOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0170 THAT NO PRICE WOULD BE TOO GREAT TO PAY FOR IT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0171 A FRESH OPPORTUNITY WAS NOW ABOUT TO OCCUR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0172 TO STUDY THE MUCH DISCUSSED CORONA A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0173 TOTAL AT LEAST FOR THE EXTREME NORTH OF AMERICA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0174 FOR SPAIN AND NORTH AFRICA WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON JULY EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0175 IT WAS ARRANGED BETWEEN THE ASTRONOMERS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0176 THAT SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE ZONE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0177 WHERE THE ECLIPSE WOULD BE TOTAL
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0178 THOMAS BLACK WAS CHOSEN FOR THE EXPEDITION TO NORTH AMERICA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0179 AND WAS NOW MUCH IN THE SAME SITUATION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0180 AS THE ENGLISH ASTRONOMERS WHO WERE TRANSPORTED TO NORWAY AND SWEDEN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0181 ON THE OCCASION OF THE ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0182 IT WILL READILY BE IMAGINED THAT THOMAS BLACK
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0183 SEIZED WITH AVIDITY THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED HIM OF STUDYING THIS LUMINOUS HALO
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0184 HE WAS ALSO TO EXAMINE INTO THE NATURE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0185 OF THE RED PROMINENCES WHICH APPEAR ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EDGE OF THE TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0186 WHEN THE TOTALITY OF THE ECLIPSE HAS COMMENCED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0187 AND SHOULD HE BE ABLE SATISFACTORILY TO ESTABLISH THEIR ORIGIN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0188 HE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE APPLAUSE OF THE LEARNED MEN OF ALL EUROPE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0189 THOMAS BLACK EAGERLY PREPARED FOR HIS JOURNEY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0190 HE OBTAINED URGENT LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRINCIPAL AGENTS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0191 HE ASCERTAINED THAT AN EXPEDITION WAS TO GO TO THE EXTREME NORTH OF THE CONTINENT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0192 TO FOUND A NEW FORT IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO BE LOST
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0193 SO HE SET OUT CROSSED THE ATLANTIC LANDED AT NEW YORK
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0194 TRAVERSED THE LAKES TO THE RED RIVER SETTLEMENT
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0195 AND PRESSED ON FROM FORT TO FORT IN A SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0196 UNDER THE ESCORT OF A COURIER OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0197 IN SPITE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0198 BRAVING ALL THE DANGERS OF A JOURNEY ACROSS THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0199 AND ARRIVING AT FORT RELIANCE ON THE NINETEENTH MARCH
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0200 IN THE CONDITION WE HAVE DESCRIBED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0201 SUCH WAS THE EXPLANATION GIVEN BY THE ASTRONOMER TO CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0202 HE AT ONCE PLACED HIMSELF ENTIRELY AT MR BLACK'S SERVICE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0203 BUT COULD NOT REFRAIN
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0204 FROM INQUIRING WHY HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH A GREAT HURRY TO ARRIVE
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0205 WHEN THE ECLIPSE WAS NOT TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0206 EIGHTEEN SIXTY BUT CAPTAIN REPLIED THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0207 I HAD HEARD THAT THE COMPANY WAS SENDING AN EXPEDITION
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0208 ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST OF AMERICA AND
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0209 I DID NOT WISH TO MISS THE DEPARTURE OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0210 MR BLACK REPLIED THE CAPTAIN IF THE LIEUTENANT HAD ALREADY STARTED
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0211 I SHOULD HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO ACCOMPANY YOU MYSELF TO THE SHORES OF THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0212 AND WITH FRESH ASSURANCES OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO SERVE HIM
starlite-20070615-fur3/wav/fur0213 THE CAPTAIN AGAIN BADE HIS NEW GUEST WELCOME TO FORT RELIANCE

starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0005 A FACTORY ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THE LAKES BEYOND THE SIXTY FIRST PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0006 IS THAT CALLED THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0007 IT IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES LONG BY FIFTY ACROSS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0008 AND IS SITUATED EXACTLY AT SIXTY ONE DEGREES TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0009 AND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DEGREES WEST LONGITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0010 THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS SLOPE DOWN TO IT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0011 AND IT COMPLETELY FILLS A VAST NATURAL HOLLOW
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0012 THE POSITION OF THE LAKE IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE HUNTING DISTRICTS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0013 ONCE SWARMING WITH GAME EARLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0014 NUMEROUS STREAMS EITHER TAKE THEIR RISE FROM IT OR FLOW INTO IT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0015 THE MACKENZIE THE ATHABASCA ETC AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT FORTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON ITS SHORES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0016 FORT PROVIDENCE ON THE NORTH AND FORT RESOLUTION ON THE SOUTH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0017 FORT RELIANCE IS SITUATED ON THE NORTH EAST EXTREMITY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0018 AND IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CHESTERFIELD INLET
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0019 A LONG NARROW ESTUARY FORMED BY THE WATERS OF HUDSON'S BAY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0020 THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS DOTTED WITH LITTLE ISLANDS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0021 THE GRANITE AND GNEISS OF WHICH THEY ARE FORMED JUTTING UP IN SEVERAL PLACES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0022 ITS NORTHERN BANKS ARE CLOTHED WITH THICK WOODS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0023 SHUTTING OUT THE BARREN FROZEN DISTRICT BEYOND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0024 NOT INAPTLY CALLED THE CURSED LAND THE SOUTHERN REGIONS ON THE OTHER BAND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0025 ARE FLAT WITHOUT A RISE OF ANY KIND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0026 AND THE SOIL IS MOSTLY CALCAREOUS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0027 THE LARGE RUMINANTS OF THE POLAR DISTRICTS THE BUFFALOES OR BISONS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0028 THE FLESH OF WHICH FORMS ALMOST THE ONLY FOOD OF THE CANADIAN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0029 AND NATIVE HUNTERS SELDOM GO FURTHER NORTH THAN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0030 THE TREES ON THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0031 FORM MAGNIFICENT FORESTS WE NEED NOT BE ASTONISHED AT MEETING WITH SUCH FINE VEGETATION
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0032 IN THIS REMOTE DISTRICT THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0033 IS NOT REALLY IN A HIGHER LATITUDE THAN STOCKHOLM OR CHRISTIANIA
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0034 WE HAVE ONLY TO REMEMBER THAT THE ISOTHERMAL LINES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0035 OR BELTS OF EQUAL HEAT ALONG WHICH HEAT IS DISTRIBUTED IN EQUAL QUANTITIES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0036 DO NOT FOLLOW THE TERRESTRIAL PARALLELS AND THAT WITH THE SAME LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0037 AMERICA IS EVER SO MUCH COLDER THAN EUROPE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0038 IN APRIL THE STREETS OF NEW YORK ARE STILL WHITE WITH SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0039 YET THE LATITUDE OF NEW YORK IS NEARLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE AZORES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0040 THE NATURE OF A COUNTRY ITS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE OCEANS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0041 AND EVEN THE CONFORMATION OF ITS SOIL ALL INFLUENCE ITS CLIMATE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0042 IN SUMMER FORT RELIANCE WAS SURROUNDED WITH MASSES OF VERDURE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0043 REFRESHING TO THE SIGHT AFTER THE LONG DREARY WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0044 TIMBER WAS PLENTIFUL IN THESE FORESTS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0045 WHICH CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF POPLAR PINE AND BIRCH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0046 THE ISLETS ON THE LAKE PRODUCED VERY FINE WILLOWS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0047 GAME WAS ABUNDANT IN THE UNDERWOOD EVEN DURING THE BAD SEASON
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0048 FURTHER SOUTH THE HUNTERS FROM THE FORT SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED BISONS ELKS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0049 AND CANADIAN PORCUPINES THE FLESH OF WHICH IS EXCELLENT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0050 THE WATERS OF THE SLAVE LAKE WERE FULL OF FISH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0051 TROUT IN THEM ATTAINED TO AN IMMENSE SIZE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0052 THEIR WEIGHT OFTEN EXCEEDING FORTY POUNDS PIKES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0053 VORACIOUS LOBES A SORT OF CHARR OR GRAYLING CALLED BLUE FISH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0054 AND COUNTLESS LEGIONS OF TITTAMEGS THE COREGONUS OF NATURALISTS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0055 DISPORTED THEMSELVES IN THE WATER SO THAT THE INHABITANTS OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0056 WERE WELL SUPPLIED WITH FOOD
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0057 NATURE PROVIDED FOR ALL THEIR WANTS AND CLOTHED IN THE SKINS OF FOXES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0058 MARTENS BEARS AND OTHER ARCTIC ANIMALS THEY WERE ABLE TO BRAVE THE RIGOUR OF THE WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0059 THE FORT PROPERLY SO CALLED CONSISTED OF A WOODEN HOUSE WITH A GROUND FLOOR
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0060 AND ONE UPPER STOREY IN IT LIVED THE COMMANDANT AND HIS OFFICERS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0061 THE BARRACKS FOR THE SOLDIERS THE MAGAZINES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OFFICES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0062 WHERE EXCHANGES WERE MADE SURROUNDED THIS HOUSE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0063 A LITTLE CHAPEL WHICH WANTED NOTHING BUT A CLERGYMAN AND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0064 A POWDER MAGAZINE COMPLETED THE BUILDINGS OF THE SETTLEMENT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0065 THE WHOLE WAS SURROUNDED BY PALISADES TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0066 DEFENDED BY A SMALL BASTION
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0067 WITH A POINTED ROOF AT EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PARALLELOGRAM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0068 FORMED BY THE ENCEINTE THE FORT WAS THUS PROTECTED FROM SURPRISE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0069 A NECESSARY PRECAUTION IN THE DAYS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0070 WHEN THE INDIANS INSTEAD OF BEING THE PURVEYORS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0071 FOUGHT FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0072 AND WHEN THE AGENTS AND SOLDIERS OF RIVAL ASSOCIATIONS DISPUTED THE POSSESSION OF THE RICH FUR COUNTRY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0073 AT THAT TIME THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0074 EMPLOYED ABOUT A MILLION MEN ON ITS TERRITORIES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0075 IT HELD SUPREME AUTHORITY OVER THEM AN AUTHORITY WHICH COULD EVEN INFLICT DEATH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0076 THE GOVERNORS OF THE FACTORIES COULD REGULATE SALARIES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0077 AND ARBITRARILY FIX THE PRICE OF PROVISIONS AND FURS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0078 AND AS A RESULT OF THIS IRRESPONSIBLE POWER THEY OFTEN REALISED A PROFIT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0079 OF NO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED PER CENT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0080 WE SHALL SEE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0081 TAKEN FROM THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN ROBERT LADE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0082 ON WHAT TERMS EXCHANGES WERE FORMERLY MADE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0083 WITH THOSE INDIANS WHO HAVE SINCE BECOME THE BEST HUNTERS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0084 BEAVERS SKINS WERE THEN THE CURRENCY EMPLOYED IN BUYING AND SELLING
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0085 THE INDIANS PAID FOR ONE GUN TEN BEAVER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0086 HALF A POUND OF POWDER ONE BEAVER SKIN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0087 FOUR POUNDS OF SHOT ONE BEAVER SKIN ONE AXE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0088 ONE BEAVER SKIN SIX KNIVES ONE BEAVER SKIN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0089 ONE POUND OF GLASS BEADS ONE BEAVER SKIN ONE LACED COAT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0090 SIX BEAVER SKINS ONE COAT NOT LACED FIVE BEAVER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0091 ONE LACED FEMALE DRESS SIX BEAVER SKINS ONE POUND OF TOBACCO
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0092 ONE BEAVER SKIN ONE BOX OF POWDER ONE BEAVER SKIN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0093 ONE COMB AND ONE LOOKING GLASS TWO BEAVER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0094 BUT A FEW YEARS AGO BEAVER SKINS BECAME SO SCARCE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0095 THAT THE CURRENCY HAD TO BE CHANGED
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0096 BISON FURS ARE NOW THE MEDIUM OF TRADE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0097 WHEN AN INDIAN PRESENTS HIMSELF AT THE FORT THE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0098 AGENTS OF THE COMPANY GIVE HIM AS MANY PIECES OF WOOD AS HE BRINGS SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0099 AND HE EXCHANGES THESE PIECES OF WOOD FOR MANUFACTURED ARTICLES ON THE PREMISES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0100 AND AS THE COMPANY FIX THE PRICE OF THE ARTICLES THEY BUY AND SELL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0101 THEY CANNOT FAIL TO REALISE LARGE PROFITS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0102 SUCH WAS THE MODE OF PROCEEDING IN FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0103 AND OTHER FACTORIES SO THAT MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0104 WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORKING OF THE SYSTEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0105 DURING HER STAY WHICH EXTENDED UNTIL THE SIXTEENTH APRIL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0106 MANY A LONG TALK DID SHE HAVE WITH LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0107 MANY WERE THE PROJECTS THEY FORMED
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0108 AND FIRMLY WERE THEY BOTH DETERMINED TO ALLOW NO OBSTACLE TO CHECK THEIR ADVANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0109 AS FOR THOMAS BLACK HE NEVER OPENED HIS LIPS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0110 EXCEPT WHEN HIS OWN SPECIAL MISSION WAS DISCUSSED
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0111 HE WAS WRAPPED UP IN THE SUBJECT OF THE LUMINOUS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0112 AND RED PROMINENCES OF THE MOON HE LIVED BUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0113 AND IN THE END MADE MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0114 NEARLY AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS HIMSELF HOW EAGER THE TWO
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0115 WERE TO CROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0116 AND HOW FAR OFF THE EIGHTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0117 APPEARED TO BOTH BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE IMPATIENT GREENWICH ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0118 CAN EASILY BE IMAGINED THE PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0119 COULD NOT BE COMMENCED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF MARCH
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0120 AND A MONTH PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE COMPLETED
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0121 IN FACT IT WAS A FORMIDABLE UNDERTAKING TO ORGANISE SUCH AN EXPEDITION
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0122 FOR CROSSING THE POLAR REGIONS EVERYTHING HAD TO BETAKEN WITH THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0123 FOOD CLOTHES TOOLS ARMS AMMUNITION AND A NONDESCRIPT COLLECTION OF VARIOUS REQUISITES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0124 THE TROOPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0125 WERE ONE CHIEF AND TWO SUBORDINATE OFFICERS WITH TEN SOLDIERS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0126 THREE OF WHOM TOOK THEIR WIVES WITH THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0127 THEY WERE ALL PICKED MEN CHOSEN BY CAPTAIN CRAVENTY

starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0169 THE PARTY MIGHT HAVE RELIED FOR PROVISIONS ON THE HUNTERS AMONGST THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0170 SOME OF THE SOLDIERS WERE SKILFUL TRACKERS OF GAME
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0171 AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF REINDEER IN THE POLAR REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0172 WHOLE TRIBES OF INDIANS OR ESQUIMAUX DEPRIVED OF BREAD AND ALL OTHER NOURISHMENT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0173 SUBSIST ENTIRELY ON THIS VENISON WHICH IS BOTH ABUNDANT AND PALATABLE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0174 BUT AS DELAYS AND DIFFICULTIES HAD TO BE ALLOWED FOR
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0175 A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS WAS TAKEN WITH THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0176 THE FLESH OF THE BISON ELK AND DEER
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0177 AMASSED IN THE LARGE BATTUES ON THE SOUTH OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0178 CORNED BEEF WHICH WILL KEEP FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0179 AND SOME INDIAN PREPARATIONS IN WHICH THE FLESH OF ANIMALS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0180 GROUND TO POWDER RETAINS ITS NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES IN A VERY SMALL BULK
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0181 REQUIRING NO COOKING AND FORMING A VERY NOURISHING DIET
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0182 WERE AMONGST THE STORES PROVIDED IN CASE OF NEED
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0183 LIEUTENANT HOBSON LIKEWISE TOOK SEVERAL CASKS OF RUM AND WHISKY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0184 BUT HE WAS FIRMLY RESOLVED TO ECONOMISE THESE SPIRITS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0185 SO INJURIOUS TO THE HEALTH IN COLD LATITUDES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0186 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE COMPANY HAD PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0187 A LITTLE PORTABLE MEDICINE CHEST CONTAINING FORMIDABLE QUANTITIES OF LIME JUICE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0188 LEMONS AND OTHER SIMPLE REMEDIES NECESSARY TO CHECK
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0189 OR IF POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE SCORBUTIC AFFECTIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0190 WHICH TAKE SUCH A TERRIBLE FORM IN THESE REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0191 ALL THE MEN HAD BEEN CHOSEN WITH GREAT CARE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0192 NONE WERE TOO STOUT OR TOO THIN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0193 AND ALL HAD FOR YEARS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE SEVERITY OF THE CLIMATE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0194 AND COULD THEREFORE MORE EASILY ENDURE THE FATIGUES OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0195 THEY WERE ALL BRAVE HIGH SPIRITED FELLOWS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0196 WHO HAD TAKEN SERVICE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0197 DOUBLE PAY HAD BEEN PROMISED THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0198 DURING THEIR STAY AT THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0199 SHOULD THEY SUCCEED IN MAKING A SETTLEMENT BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0200 THE SLEDGE PROVIDED FOR MRS BARNETT AND HER FAITHFUL MADGE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0201 WAS RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE OTHERS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0202 SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE TREATED BETTER THAN HER TRAVELLING COMPANIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0203 BUT YIELDED TO THE URGENT REQUEST OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0204 WHO WAS BUT CARRYING OUT THE WISHES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0205 THE VEHICLE WHICH BROUGHT THOMAS BLACK TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0206 ALSO CONVEYED HIM AND HIS SCIENTIFIC APPARATUS FROM IT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0207 A FEW ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH THERE WERE NOT MANY IN THOSE DAYS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0208 A TELESCOPE FOR HIS SELENOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS A SEXTANT FOR TAKING THE LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0209 A CHRONOMETER FOR DETERMINING THE LONGITUDES A FEW MAPS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0210 A FEW BOOKS WERE ALL STORED AWAY IN THIS SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0211 AND THOMAS BLACK RELIED UPON HIS FAITHFUL DOGS TO LOSE NOTHING BY THE WAY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0212 OF COURSE THE FOOD FOR THE VARIOUS TEAMS WAS NOT FORGOTTEN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0213 THERE WERE ALTOGETHER NO LESS THAN SEVENTY TWO DOGS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0214 QUITE A HERD TO PROVIDE FOR BY THE WAY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0215 AND IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE HUNTERS TO CATER FOR THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0216 THESE STRONG INTELLIGENT ANIMALS WERE BOUGHT OF THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0217 WHO KNOW WELL HOW TO TRAIN THEM FOR THEIR ARDUOUS CALLING
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0218 THE LITTLE COMPANY WAS MOST SKILFULLY ORGANISED THE ZEAL OF LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0219 WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE PROUD OF HIS MISSION AND DEVOTED TO HIS TASK
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0220 HE NEGLECTED NOTHING WHICH COULD INSURE SUCCESS CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0221 ALWAYS A BUSYBODY EXERTED HIMSELF WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY VERY TANGIBLE RESULTS
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0222 BUT HIS WIFE WAS MOST USEFUL AND DEVOTED AND MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0223 HAD ALREADY STRUCK UP A GREAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE BRISK LITTLE CANADIAN WOMAN
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0224 WHOSE FAIR HAIR AND LARGE SOFT EYES WERE SO PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0225 WE NEED SCARCELY ADD THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0226 DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO FURTHER THE ENTERPRISE THE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0227 INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0228 SHOWED WHAT GREAT IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACHED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION AND
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0229 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FACTORY BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0230 WE MAY THEREFORE SAFELY AFFIRM THAT EVERY HUMAN EFFORT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0231 LIKELY TO INSURE SUCCESS WHICH COULD BE MADE WAS MADE
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0232 BUT WHO COULD TELL WHAT INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0233 NATURE MIGHT PLACE IN THE PATH OF THE BRAVE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070615-fur4/wav/fur0234 WHO COULD TELL WHAT AWAITED HIM AND HIS DEVOTED LITTLE BAND

starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0005 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER SEVEN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0006 THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THE EXPEDITION CONTINUED TO ADVANCE TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0007 BUT THE GREAT INEQUALITIES OF THE GROUND
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0008 MADE IT HARD WORK FOR THE DOGS TO GET ALONG
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0009 AND THE POOR CREATURES WHO COULD HARDLY BE HELD IN WHEN THEY STARTED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0010 WERE NOW QUIET ENOUGH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0011 EIGHT OR TEN MILES A DAY WERE AS MUCH AS THEY COULD ACCOMPLISH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0012 ALTHOUGH LIEUTENANT HOBSON URGED THEM ON TO THE UTMOST
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0013 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET TO FORT CONFIDENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0014 ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0015 WHERE HE HOPED TO OBTAIN SOME USEFUL INFORMATION
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0016 HAD THE INDIANS FREQUENTING THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0017 BEEN ABLE TO CROSS THE DISTRICTS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0018 WAS THE ARCTIC OCEAN OPEN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0019 THESE WERE GRAVE QUESTIONS THE REPLY TO WHICH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0020 WOULD DECIDE THE FATE OF THE NEW FACTORY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0021 THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THE LITTLE TROOP WAS NOW PASSING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0022 WAS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS STREAMS MOSTLY TRIBUTARIES OF THE TWO LARGE RIVERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0023 THE MACKENZIE AND COPPERMINE WHICH FLOW FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0024 AND EMPTY THEMSELVES INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN LAKES LAGOONS AND NUMEROUS POOLS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0025 ARE FORMED BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCIPAL ARTERIES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0026 AND AS THEY WERE NO LONGER FROZEN OVER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0027 THE SLEDGES COULD NOT VENTURE UPON THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0028 AND WERE COMPELLED TO GO AROUND THEM WHICH CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DELAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0029 LIEUTENANT HOBSON WAS CERTAINLY RIGHT IN SAYING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0030 THAT WINTER IS THE TIME TO VISIT THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0031 FOR THEY ARE THEN FAR EASIER TO TRAVERSE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0032 MRS PAULINA BARNETT HAD REASON TO OWN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0033 THE JUSTICE OF THIS ASSERTION THAN ONCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0034 THIS REGION INCLUDED IN THE CURSED LAND WAS BESIDES COMPLETELY DESERTED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0035 AS ARE THE GREATER PORTION OF THE DISTRICTS OF THE EXTREME NORTH OF AMERICA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0036 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE IS BUT ONE INHABITANT TO EVERY TEN SQUARE MILES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0037 BESIDES THE SCATTERED NATIVES THERE ARE SOME FEW THOUSAND AGENTS OR SOLDIERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0038 OF THE DIFFERENT FUR TRADING COMPANIES BUT THEY MOSTLY CONGREGATE IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0039 AND ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORIES NO HUMAN FOOTPRINTS GLADDENED THE EYES OF THE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0040 THE ONLY TRACES ON THE SANDY SOIL WERE THOSE OF RUMINANTS AND RODENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0041 NOW AND THEN A FIERCE POLAR BEAR WAS SEEN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0042 AND MRS PAULINA BARNETT EXPRESSED HER SURPRISE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0043 AT NOT MEETING MORE OF THESE TERRIBLE CARNIVOROUS BEASTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0044 OF WHOSE DAILY ATTACKS ON WHALERS AND PERSONS SHIPWRECKED IN BAFFIN'S BAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0045 AND ON THE COASTS OF GREENLAND AND SPITZBERGEN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0046 SHE HAD READ IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0047 WHO HAD WINTERED IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS WAIT FOR THE WINTER MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0048 REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT WAIT TILL THE COLD MAKES THEM HUNGRY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0049 AND THEN YOU WILL PERHAPS SEE AS MANY AS YOU CARE ABOUT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0050 ON THE TWENTY THIRD MAY AFTER A LONG AND FATIGUING JOURNEY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0051 THE EXPEDITION AT LAST REACHED THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0052 WE KNOW THAT THIS LATITUDE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0053 TWENTY THREE DEGREES TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS FROM THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0054 FORMS THE MATHEMATICAL LIMIT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0055 BEYOND WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN DO NOT PENETRATE IN THE WINTER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0056 WHEN THE NORTHERN DISTRICTS OF THE GLOBE ARE TURNED AWAY FROM THE ORB OF DAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0057 HERE THEN THE TRAVELLERS ENTERED THE TRUE ARCTIC REGION
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0058 THE NORTHERN FRIGID ZONE THE LATITUDE HAD BEEN VERY CAREFULLY OBTAINED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0059 BY MEANS OF MOST ACCURATE INSTRUMENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0060 WHICH WERE HANDLED WITH EQUAL SKILL BY THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0061 AND BY LIEUTENANT HOBSON MRS BARNETT WAS PRESENT AT THE OPERATION
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0062 AND HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HEARING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0063 THAT SHE WAS AT LAST ABOUT TO CROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0064 IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF JUST PRIDE THAT SHE RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0065 YOU HAVE ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THE TWO TORRID ZONES IN YOUR PREVIOUS JOURNEYS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0066 SAID THE LIEUTENANT AND NOW YOU ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0067 FEW EXPLORERS HAVE VENTURED INTO SUCH TOTALLY DIFFERENT REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0068 SOME SO TO SPEAK HAVE A SPECIALTY FOR HOT COUNTRIES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0069 AND CHOOSE AFRICA OR AUSTRALIA AS THE FIELD FOR THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0070 SUCH WERE BARTH BURTON LIVINGSTONE SPEKE DOUGLAS STUART ETC
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0071 OTHERS ON THE CONTRARY HAVE A PASSION FOR THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0072 STILL SO LITTLE KNOWN MACKENZIE FRANKLIN PENNY KANE PARRY RAE ETC
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0073 PRECEDED US ON OUR PRESENT JOURNEY BUT WE MUST CONGRATULATE YOU MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0074 ON BEING A MORE COSMOPOLITAN TRAVELLER THAN ALL OF THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0075 I MUST SEE EVERYTHING OR AT LEAST TRY TO SEE EVERYTHING LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0076 REPLIED MRS PAULINA AND I THINK THE DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0077 ARE ABOUT EQUAL EVERYWHERE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0078 ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT TO DREAD THE FEVERS OF THE UNHEALTHY TORRID REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0079 OR THE ATTACKS OF THE FIERCE BLACK RACES IN THIS FRIGID ZONE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0080 THE COLD IS A NO LESS FORMIDABLE ENEMY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0081 AND I SUSPECT THAT THE WHITE BEARS WE ARE LIABLE TO MEET WITH HERE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0082 WILL GIVE US QUITE AS WARM A RECEPTION AS WOULD THE TIERS OF THIBET
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0083 OR THE LIONS OF AFRICA IN TORRID AND FRIGID ZONES ALIKE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0084 THERE ARE VAST UNEXPLORED TRACTS WHICH WILL LONG DEFY THE EFFORTS OF THE BOLDEST ADVENTURERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0085 YES MADAM REPLIED JASPAR HOBSON BUT I THINK THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0086 WILL LONGER RESIST THOROUGH EXPLORATION THE NATIVES ARE THE CHIEF OBSTACLE IN TROPICAL REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0087 AND I AM WELL AWARE HOW MANY TRAVELLERS HAVE FALLEN VICTIMS TO SAVAGES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0088 BUT CIVILISATION WILL NECESSARILY SUBDUE THE WILD RACES SOONER OR LATER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0089 WHEREAS IN THE ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC ZONES IT IS NOT THE INHABITANTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0090 WHO ARREST THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPLORER BUT NATURE HERSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0091 WHO REPELS THOSE WHO APPROACH HER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0092 AND PARALYSES THEIR ENERGIES WITH THE BITTER COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0093 YOU THINK THEN THAT THE SECRETS OF THE MOST REMOTE DISTRICTS OF AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0094 WILL HAVE BEEN FATHOMED BEFORE THE FRIGID ZONE HAS BEEN ENTIRELY EXAMINED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0095 YES MADAM REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT AND I THINK MY OPINION IS FOUNDED ON FACTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0096 THE MOST INTREPID DISCOVERERS OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS PARRY PENNY FRANKLIN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0097 MCCLURE DANE AND MORTON DID NOT GET BEYOND EIGHTY THREE DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0098 SEVEN DEGREES FROM THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0099 WHEREAS AUSTRALIA HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN CROSSED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BY THE BOLD STUART
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0100 AND EVEN AFRICA WITH ALL ITS TERRORS WAS TRAVERSED BY LIVINGSTONE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0101 FROM THE BAY OF LOANGA TO THE MOUTH OF THE ZAMBESI
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0102 WE ARE THEREFORE NEARER TO GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE EQUATORIAL COUNTRIES THAN OF THE POLAR DISTRICTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0103 DO YOU THINK THAT THE POLE ITSELF WILL EVER BE REACHED BY MAN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0104 INQUIRED MRS PAULINA BARNETT CERTAINLY REPLIED HOBSON ADDING WITH A SMILE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0105 BY MAN OR WOMAN BUT I THINK OTHER MEANS MUST BE TRIED OF REACHING THIS POINT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0106 WHERE ALL THE MERIDIANS OF THE GLOBE CROSS EACH OTHER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0107 THAN THOSE HITHERTO ADOPTED BY TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0108 WE HEAR OF THE OPEN SEA OF WHICH CERTAIN EXPLORERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0109 ARE SAID TO HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0110 BUT IF SUCH A SEA FREE FROM ICE REALLY EXIST
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0111 IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET AT AND NO ONE CAN SAY POSITIVELY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0112 WHETHER IT EXTENDS TO THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0113 FOR MY PART I THINK AN OPEN SEA WOULD INCREASE RATHER THAN LESSEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF EXPLORERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0114 AS FOR ME I WOULD RATHER COUNT UPON FIRM FOOTING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0115 WHETHER ON ICE OR ROCK ALL THE WAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0116 THEN I WOULD ORGANISE SUCCESSIVE EXPEDITIONS ESTABLISHING DEPOTS OF PROVISIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0117 AND FUEL NEARER AND NEARER TO THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0118 AND SO WITH PLENTY OF TIME PLENTY OF MONEY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0119 AND PERHAPS THE SACRIFICE OF A GOOD MANY LIVES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0120 I SHOULD IN THE END SOLVE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0121 I SHOULD I THINK AT LAST REACH THE HITHERTO INACCESSIBLE GOAL
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0122 I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT LIEUTENANT SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0123 AND IF EVER YOU TRY THE EXPERIMENT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0124 I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO JOIN YOU AND
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0125 WOULD GLADLY GO TO SET UP THE UNION JACK AT THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0126 BUT THAT IS NOT OUR PRESENT OBJECT NOT OUR IMMEDIATE OBJECT MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0127 REPLIED HOBSON BUT WHEN ONCE THE PROJECTS OF THE COMPANY ARE REALISED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0128 WHEN THE NEW FORT HAS BEEN ERECTED ON THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0129 IT MAY BECOME THE NATURAL STARTING POINT OF ALL EXPEDITIONS TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0130 BESIDES SHOULD THE FUR YIELDING ANIMALS TOO ZEALOUSLY HUNTED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0131 TAKE REFUGE AT THE POLE WE SHOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0132 UNLESS COSTLY FURS SHOULD GO OUT OF FASHION REPLIED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0133 O MADAM CRIED THE LIEUTENANT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME PRETTY WOMAN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0134 WHOSE WISH FOR A SABLE MUFF OR AN ERMINE TIPPET
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0135 MUST BE GRATIFIED I AM AFRAID SO SAID MRS BARNETT LAUGHING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0136 AND PROBABLY THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0137 WILL HAVE BEEN LED THITHER IN PURSUIT OF A SABLE OR A SILVER FOX
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0138 THAT IS MY CONVICTION REPLIED HOBSON SUCH IS HUMAN NATURE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0139 AND GREED OF GAIN WILL ALWAYS CARRY A MAN FURTHER THAN ZEAL FOR SCIENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0140 WHAT DO YOU UTTER SUCH SENTIMENTS EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT WELL MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0141 WHAT AM I BUT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0142 AND DOES THE COMPANY RISK ITS CAPITAL AND AGENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0143 WITH ANY OTHER HOPE THAN AN INCREASE OF PROFITS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0144 LIEUTENANT HOBSON SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0145 I THINK I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO ASSERT THAT ON OCCASION YOU WOULD BE READY TO DEVOTE BODY AND SOUL TO SCIENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0146 IF A PURELY GEOGRAPHICAL QUESTION CALLED YOU TO THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0147 I FEEL SURE YOU WOULD NOT HESITATE TO GO BUT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0148 SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE THE SOLUTION OF THIS GREAT PROBLEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0149 IS STILL FAR DISTANT WE HAVE BUT JUST REACHED THE VERGE OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BUT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0150 I HOPE WE MAY CROSS IT WITHOUT ANY VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0151 THAT I FEAR IS DOUBTFUL SAID THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0152 WHO HAD BEEN ATTENTIVELY EXAMINING THE SKY DURING THEIR CONVERSATION
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0153 THE WEATHER HAS LOOKED THREATENING FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0154 LOOK AT THE UNIFORMLY GREY HUE OF THE HEAVENS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0155 THAT MIST WILL PRESENTLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0156 AND IF THE WIND SHOULD RISE EVER SO LITTLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0157 WE SHALL HAVE TO BATTLE WITH A FEARFUL STORM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0158 I WISH WE WERE AT THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0159 DO NOT LET US LOSE ANY TIME THEN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0160 SAID MRS BARNETT RISING GIVE THE SIGNAL TO START AT ONCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0161 THE LIEUTENANT NEEDED NO URGING
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0162 HAD HE BEEN ALONE OR ACCOMPANIED BY A FEW MEN AS ENERGETIC AS HIMSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0163 HE WOULD HAVE PRESSED ON DAY AND NIGHT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0164 BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THE FATIGUE OF OTHERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0165 ALTHOUGH HE NEVER SPARED HIMSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0166 HE THEREFORE GRANTED A FEW HOURS OF REST TO HIS LITTLE PARTY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0167 AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THREE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THEY AGAIN SET
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0168 OUT JASPAR HOBSON WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN PROPHESYING A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0169 IT CAME VERY SOON DURING THE AFTERNOON OF THE SAME DAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0170 THE MIST BECAME THICKER AND ASSUMED A YELLOWISH AND THREATENING HUE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0171 THE LIEUTENANT ALTHOUGH VERY UNEASY ALLOWED NONE OF HIS ANXIETY TO APPEAR
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0172 BUT HAD A LONG CONSULTATION WITH SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0173 WHILST THE DOGS OF HIS SLEDGE WERE LABORIOUSLY PREPARING TO START
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0174 UNFORTUNATELY THE DISTRICT NOW TO BE TRAVERSED WAS VERY UNSUITABLE FOR SLEDGES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0175 THE GROUND WAS VERY UNEVEN RAVINES WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0176 AND MASSES OF GRANITE OR HALF THAWED ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0177 BLOCKED UP THE ROAD CAUSING CONSTANT DELAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0178 THE POOR DOGS DID THEIR BEST
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0179 BUT THE DRIVERS WHIPS NO LONGER PRODUCED ANY EFFECT UPON THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0180 AND SO THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS MEN WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO WALK
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0181 TO REST THE EXHAUSTED ANIMALS TO PUSH THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0182 OR EVEN SOMETIMES TO LIFT THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0183 WHEN THE ROUGHNESS OF THE GROUND THREATENED TO UPSET THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0184 THE INCESSANT FATIGUE WAS HOWEVER BORNE BY ALL WITHOUT A MURMUR
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0185 THOMAS BLACK ALONE ABSORBED IN HIS ONE IDEA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0186 NEVER GOT OUT OF HIS SLEDGE AND INDEED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0187 BE WAS SO CORPULENT THAT ALL EXERTION WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HIM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0188 THE NATURE OF THE SOIL CHANGED FROM THE MOMENT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0189 OF ENTERING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE SOME GEOLOGICAL CONVULSION HAD EVIDENTLY UPHEAVED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0190 THE ENORMOUS BLOCKS STREWN UPON THE SURFACE THE VEGETATION TOO
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0191 WAS OF A MORE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0192 WHEREVER THEY WERE SHELTERED FROM THE KEEN NORTH WINDS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0193 THE FLANKS OF THE HILLS WERE CLOTHED NOT ONLY WITH SHRUBS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0194 BUT WITH LARGE TREES ALL OF THE SAME SPECIES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0195 PINES WILLOWS AND FIRS PROVING BY THEIR PRESENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0196 THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VEGETATIVE FORCE IS RETAINED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0197 EVEN IN THE FRIGID ZONE JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0198 HOPED TO FIND SUCH SPECIMENS OF THE ARCTIC FLORA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0199 EVEN ON THE VERGE OF THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0200 FOR THESE TREES WOULD SUPPLY HIM WITH WOOD TO BUILD HIS FORT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0201 AND FUEL TO WARM ITS INHABITANTS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0202 THE SAME THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH THE MINDS OF HIS COMPANIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0203 AND THEY COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS COMPARATIVELY FERTILE REGION
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0204 AND THE LONG WHITE PLAINS STRETCHING BETWEEN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0205 AND FORT ENTERPRISE AT NIGHT THE YELLOW MIST BECAME MORE OPAQUE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0206 THE WIND ROSE THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL IN LARGE FLAKES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0207 AND THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH A THICK WHITE CARPET
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0208 IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THE SNOW WAS A FOOT DEEP
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0209 AND AS IT DID NOT FREEZE BUT REMAINED IN A LIQUID STATE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0210 THE SLEDGES COULD ONLY ADVANCE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0211 THE CURVED FRONTS STUCK IN THE SOFT SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0212 AND THE DOGS WERE OBLIGED TO STOP AGAIN AND AGAIN
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0213 TOWARDS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE WIND BECAME VERY BOISTEROUS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0214 THE SNOW DRIVEN BEFORE IT WAS FLUNG UPON THE GROUND
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0215 OR WHIRLED IN THE AIR FORMING ONE HUGE WHIRLPOOL
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0216 THE DOGS BEATEN BACK BY THE SQUALL AND BLINDED WITH SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0217 COULD ADVANCE NO FURTHER THE PARTY WAS THEN IN A NARROW GORGE BETWEEN HUGE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0218 OVER WHICH THE STORM RAGED WITH FEARFUL FURY PIECES OF ICE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0219 BROKEN OFF BY THE HURRICANE WERE HURLED INTO THE PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0220 PARTIAL AVALANCHES ANY ONE OF WHICH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0221 COULD HAVE CRUSHED THE SLEDGES AND THEIR INMATES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0222 ADDED TO ITS DANGERS AND TO PRESS ON BECAME IMPOSSIBLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0223 THE LIEUTENANT NO LONGER INSISTED AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0224 GAVE THE ORDER TO HALT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0225 IT WAS NOW NECESSARY TO FIND A SHELTER FROM THE SNOW DRIFT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0226 BUT THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO MEN ACCUSTOMED TO POLAR EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0227 JASPAR HOBSON AND HIS MEN KNEW WELL WHAT THEY HAD TO DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0228 IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY A TEMPEST
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0229 SOME HUNDRED MILES FROM THE FORTS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0230 WITHOUT SO MUCH AS AN ESQUIMAUX HUT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0231 OR INDIAN HOVEL IN WHICH TO LAY THEIR HEADS TO
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0232 THE ICEBERGS TO THE ICEBERGS CRIED JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0233 EVERY ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0234 SNOW HOUSES WERE TO BE HOLLOWED OUT OF THE FROZEN MASSES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0235 OR RATHER HOLES WERE TO BE DUG IN WHICH EACH PERSON
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0236 COULD COWER UNTIL THE STORM WAS OVER KNIVES AND HATCHETS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0237 WERE SOON AT WORK ON THE BRITTLE MASSES OF ICE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0238 AND IN THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0239 SOME TEN DENS HAD BEEN SCOOPED OUT LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN TWO OR THREE PERSONS EACH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0240 THE DOGS WERE LEFT TO THEMSELVES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0241 THEIR OWN INSTINCT LEADING THEM TO FIND SUFFICIENT SHELTER UNDER THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0242 BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK ALL THE TRAVELLERS WERE CROUCHING IN THE SNOW HOUSES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0243 IN GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE EACH CHOOSING CONGENIAL COMPANIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0244 MRS BARNETT MADGE AND LIEUTENANT HOBSON OCCUPIED ONE HUT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0245 THOMAS BLACK AND SERGEANT LONG ANOTHER AND SO ON
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0246 THESE RETREATS WERE WARM IF NOT COMFORTABLE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0247 AND THE ESQUIMAUX AND INDIANS HAVE NO OTHER REFUGE EVEN IN THE BITTEREST COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0248 THE ADVENTURERS COULD THEREFORE FEARLESSLY AWAIT THE END OF THE STORM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0249 AS LONG AS THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO LET THE OPENINGS OF THEIR HOLES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0250 BECOME BLOCKED UP WITH THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0251 WHICH THEY HAD TO SHOVEL AWAY EVERY HALF HOUR
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0252 SO VIOLENT WAS THE STORM THAT EVEN THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS SOLDIERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0253 COULD SCARCELY SET FOOT OUTSIDE FORTUNATELY ALL WERE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT FOOD
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0254 AND WERE ABLE TO ENDURE THEIR BEAVER LIKE EXISTENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0255 WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM COLD OR HUNGER
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0256 FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FURY OF THE TEMPEST CONTINUED TO INCREASE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0257 THE WIND ROARED IN THE NARROW PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0258 AND TORE OFF THE TOPS OF THE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0259 LOUD REPORTS REPEATED TWENTY TIMES BY THE ECHOES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0260 GAVE NOTICE OF THE FALL OF AVALANCHES AND JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0261 BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HIS FURTHER PROGRESS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0262 WOULD BE BARRED BY THE MASSES OF DEBRIS ACCUMULATED BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0263 OTHER SOUNDS MINGLED WITH THESE REPORTS WHICH LIEUTENANT HOBSON KNEW TOO WELL
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0264 AND HE DID NOT DISGUISE FROM MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0265 THAT BEARS WERE PROWLING ABOUT THE PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0266 BUT FORTUNATELY THESE TERRIBLE ANIMALS WERE TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR OWN CONCERNS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0267 TO DISCOVER THE RETREAT OF THE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0268 NEITHER THE DOGS NOR THE SLEDGES BURIED IN THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0269 ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION AND THEY PASSED ON WITHOUT DOING ANY HARM
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0270 THE LAST NIGHT THAT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OR TWENTY SIXTH MAY
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0271 WAS EVEN MORE TERRIBLE SO GREAT WAS THE FURY OF THE HURRICANE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0272 THAT A GENERAL OVERTHROW OF ICEBERGS APPEARED IMMINENT A FEARFUL DEATH
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0273 WOULD THEN HAVE AWAITED THE UNFORTUNATE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0274 BENEATH THE RUINS OF THE BROKEN MASSES
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0275 THE BLOCKS OF ICE CRACKED WITH AN AWFUL NOISE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0276 AND CERTAIN OSCILLATIONS GAVE WARNING THAT BREACHES HAD BEEN MADE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0277 THREATENING THEIR SOLIDITY HOWEVER NO GREAT CRASH OCCURRED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0278 THE HUGE MOUNTAINS REMAINED INTACT AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE NIGHT
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0279 ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN CHANGES SO FREQUENT IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS TOOK PLACE
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0280 THE TEMPEST CEASED SUDDENLY BENEATH THE INFLUENCE OF INTENSE COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0281 AND WITH THE FIRST DAWN OF DAY PEACE WAS RESTORED
starlite-20070618-fur7/wav/fur0282 END OF CHAPTER SEVEN
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-att/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-hxe/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-ooy/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-vdl/wav/b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xos/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
SteliosKoroneos-20090926-xvv/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
Steltek-20090509-abj/wav/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
Steltek-20090509-axe/wav/a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
Steltek-20090509-bjl/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Steltek-20090509-bra/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
Steltek-20090509-dth/wav/b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Steltek-20090509-evm/wav/a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
Steltek-20090509-gea/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
Steltek-20090509-gum/wav/b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
Steltek-20090509-qgv/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
Steltek-20090509-twd/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
Steltek-20090509-xod/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
Steltek-20090509-zle/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
Steltek-20090509-zma/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
Steltek-20090530-knu/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Steltek-20090530-ogw/wav/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
Steltek-20090530-soj/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
stephsphynx-20080829-eyq/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
stephsphynx-20080829-ezq/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
stephsphynx-20080829-mtp/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
stephsphynx-20080829-qph/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
stephsphynx-20080829-rea/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
stephsphynx-20080829-sff/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
stephsphynx-20080829-tda/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
sunflame-20090525-hgf/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
susrut-20090104-bns/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
sydb-20090506-ehj/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
sydb-20090506-fzn/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
sydb-20090506-nun/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
sydb-20090506-owh/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
sydb-20090506-sbb/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
sydb-20090506-spf/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
sydb-20090506-vql/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
sydb-20090506-yli/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
sza-20080221-dvr/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
Tamashii-20090303-nld/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
tarciana-20081009-laj/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
taslack-20090113-epc/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
taslack-20090113-vno/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
taslack-20090114-mfh/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
taslack-20090114-rmt/wav/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
tbudicin-20090512-bkr/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE

Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
Tebbra-20090423-ptc/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN

Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
Tebbra-20090423-tyk/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
TechnoZeus-20090805-cfr/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK

TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
TechnoZeus-20090805-fnq/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
TechnoZeus-20090805-mir/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
TechnoZeus-20090805-ucc/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
TechnoZeus-20090805-uqy/wav/a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
TechnoZeus-20090805-vxk/wav/b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
TechnoZeus-20090805-xzn/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TechnoZeus-20090805-yad/wav/a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
Tecwolf-20081028-ssg/wav/b0256 HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
tee-20081105-knc/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
teeks99-20090406-aai/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
teeks99-20090406-amn/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
teeks99-20090406-gah/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
teeks99-20090406-hnf/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
teeks99-20090406-vjp/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
teeks99-20090406-voa/wav/b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
teeks99-20090406-vqd/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
teeks99-20090406-xae/wav/b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
teeks99-20090406-ztj/wav/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
teeks99-20090430-cmk/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
teeks99-20090430-dof/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
teeks99-20090430-gjx/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
teeks99-20090430-jan/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
teeks99-20090430-zjo/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY

teeks99-20090430-zup/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
teeks99-20091212-ffu/wav/b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI

teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
teeks99-20091212-fgq/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
teeks99-20091212-hcd/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
teeks99-20091212-kah/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
teeks99-20091212-nqq/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER-ROOM
teeks99-20091212-xle/wav/a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED

Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

Terminus-20091217-fgp/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE

tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0013 I'VE GOT THE KEY TO THE FIDGIT'S LANGUAGE IT'S A FRIGHTFULLY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0014 QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I EVER HEARD THE ONLY THING IT REMINDS ME OF
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0015 SLIGHTLY IS ANCIENT HEBREW IT ISN'T SHELLFISH BUT IT'S A BIG STEP TOWARDS IT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0016 NOW THE NEXT THING I WANT YOU TO TAKE A PENCIL AND A FRESH NOTEBOOK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0017 AND WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING I SAY THE FIDGIT HAS PROMISED TO TELL ME THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0018 I WILL TRANSLATE IT INTO ENGLISH AND YOU PUT IT DOWN IN THE BOOK ARE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0019 YOU READY ONCE MORE THE DOCTOR LOWERED HIS EAR BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0020 AND AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK I STARTED TO WRITE AND THIS IS THE STORY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0021 THAT THE FIDGIT TOLD US THIRTEEN MONTHS IN AN AQUARIUM I WAS BORN IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0022 CLOSE TO THE COAST OF CHILE I WAS ONE OF A FAMILY OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0023 SOON AFTER OUR MOTHER AND FATHER LEFT US WE YOUNGSTERS GOT SCATTERED THE FAMILY WAS BROKEN UP
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0024 BY A HERD OF WHALES WHO CHASED US I AND MY SISTER CLIPPA
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0025 SHE WAS MY FAVORITE SISTER HAD A VERY NARROW ESCAPE FOR OUR LIVES AS A RULE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0026 WHALES ARE NOT VERY HARD TO GET AWAY FROM IF YOU ARE GOOD AT DODGING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0027 IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT A QUICK SWERVE BUT THIS ONE THAT CAME AFTER CLIPPA AND MYSELF WAS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0028 A VERY MEAN WHALE EVERY TIME HE LOST US UNDER A STONE OR SOMETHING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0029 HE'D COME BACK AND HUNT AND HUNT TILL HE ROUTED US OUT INTO THE OPEN AGAIN I NEVER SAW SUCH A NASTY PERSEVERING BRUTE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0030 WELL WE SHOOK HIM AT LAST THOUGH NOT BEFORE HE HAD WORRIED US FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES NORTHWARD
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0031 UP THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA BUT LUCK WAS AGAINST US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0032 WHILE WE WERE RESTING AND TRYING TO GET OUR BREATH
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0033 ANOTHER FAMILY OF FIDGITS CAME RUSHING BY SHOUTING COME ON SWIM FOR YOUR LIVES THE DOG FISH ARE COMING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0034 NOW DOG FISH ARE PARTICULARLY FOND OF FIDGITS WE ARE YOU MIGHT SAY THEIR FAVORITE FOOD
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0035 AND FOR THAT REASON WE ALWAYS KEEP AWAY FROM DEEP MUDDY WATERS WHAT'S MORE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0036 DOG FISH ARE NOT EASY TO ESCAPE FROM THEY ARE TERRIBLY FAST AND CLEVER HUNTERS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0037 SO UP WE HAD TO JUMP AND ON AGAIN AFTER WE HAD GONE A FEW MORE HUNDRED MILES WE LOOKED BACK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0038 AND SAW THAT THE DOG FISH WERE GAINING ON US SO WE TURNED INTO A HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0039 IT HAPPENED TO BE ONE ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES HERE WE GUESSED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0040 AND HOPED THE DOG FISH WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO FOLLOW US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0041 AS IT HAPPENED THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEE US TURN IN BUT DASHED ON NORTHWARD
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0042 AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN I HOPE THEY FROZE TO DEATH IN THE ARCTIC SEAS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0043 BUT AS I SAID LUCK WAS AGAINST US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0044 WHILE I AND MY SISTER WERE CRUISING GENTLY ROUND THE SHIPS ANCHORED IN THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0045 LOOKING FOR ORANGE PEELS A GREAT DELICACY WITH US SWOOP BANG WE WERE CAUGHT IN A NET
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0046 WE STRUGGLED FOR ALL WE WERE WORTH BUT IT WAS NO USE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0047 THE NET WAS SMALL MESHED AND STRONGLY MADE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0048 KICKING AND FLIPPING WE WERE HAULED UP THE SIDE OF THE SHIP AND DUMPED DOWN ON THE DECK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0049 HIGH AND DRY IN A BLAZING NOON DAY SUN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0050 HERE A COUPLE OF OLD MEN IN WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES LEANT OVER US MAKING STRANGE SOUNDS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0051 SOME CODLING HAD GOT CAUGHT IN THE NET THE SAME TIME AS WE WERE THESE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0052 THE OLD MEN THREW BACK INTO THE SEA BUT US THEY SEEMED TO THINK VERY PRECIOUS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0053 THEY PUT US CAREFULLY INTO A LARGE JAR AND AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN US ON SHORE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0054 THEY WENT TO A BIG HOUSE AND CHANGED US FROM THE JAR INTO GLASS BOXES FULL OF WATER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0055 THIS HOUSE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE HARBOR AND A SMALL STREAM OF SEA WATER WAS MADE TO FLOW THROUGH THE GLASS TANK SO WE COULD BREATHE PROPERLY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0056 OF COURSE WE HAD NEVER LIVED INSIDE GLASS WALLS BEFORE AND AT FIRST WE KEPT ON TRYING TO SWIM THROUGH THEM AND GOT OUR NOSES AWFULLY SORE BUMPING THE GLASS AT FULL SPEED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0057 THEN FOLLOWED WEEKS AND WEEKS OF WEARY IDLENESS THEY TREATED US WELL SO FAR AS THEY KNEW HOW
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0058 THE OLD FELLOWS IN SPECTACLES CAME AND LOOKED AT US PROUDLY TWICE A DAY AND SAW
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0059 THAT WE HAD THE PROPER FOOD TO EAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0060 THAT THE WATER WAS NOT TOO HOT OR TOO COLD BUT OH THE DULLNESS OF THAT LIFE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0061 IT SEEMED WE WERE A KIND OF A SHOW
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0062 AT A CERTAIN HOUR EVERY MORNING THE BIG DOORS OF THE HOUSE WERE THROWN OPEN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0063 AND EVERYBODY IN THE CITY WHO HAD NOTHING SPECIAL TO DO CAME IN AND LOOKED AT US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0064 THERE WERE OTHER TANKS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISHES ALL ROUND THE WALLS OF THE BIG ROOM AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0065 THE CROWDS WOULD GO FROM TANK TO TANK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0066 LOOKING IN AT US THROUGH THE GLASS WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE HALF WITTED FLOUNDERS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0067 WE GOT SO SICK OF IT THAT WE USED TO OPEN OUR MOUTHS BACK AT THEM AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0068 THIS THEY SEEMED TO THINK HIGHLY COMICAL ONE DAY MY SISTER SAID TO ME
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0069 THINK YOU BROTHER THAT THESE STRANGE CREATURES WHO HAVE CAPTURED US CAN TALK SURELY SAID I
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0070 HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THAT SOME TALK WITH THE LIPS ONLY SOME WITH THE WHOLE FACE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0071 AND YET OTHERS DISCOURSE WITH THE HANDS WHEN THEY COME QUITE CLOSE TO THE GLASS YOU CAN HEAR THEM
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0072 LISTEN AT THAT MOMENT A FEMALE LARGER THAN THE REST
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0073 PRESSED HER NOSE UP AGAINST THE GLASS POINTED AT ME AND SAID TO HER YOUNG BEHIND HER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0074 OH LOOK HERE'S A QUEER ONE AND THEN WE NOTICED THAT THEY NEARLY ALWAYS SAID THIS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0075 WHEN THEY LOOKED IN AND FOR A LONG TIME WE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE LANGUAGE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0076 THIS BEING A PEOPLE OF BUT FEW IDEAS TO HELP PASS AWAY THE WEARY HOURS WE LEARNED IT BY HEART
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0077 OH LOOK HERE'S A QUEER ONE BUT WE NEVER GOT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0078 OTHER PHRASES HOWEVER WE DID GET THE MEANING OF AND WE EVEN LEARNED TO READ A LITTLE IN MAN TALK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0079 MANY BIG SIGNS THERE WERE SET UP UPON THE WALLS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0080 AND WHEN WE SAW THAT THE KEEPERS STOPPED THE PEOPLE FROM SPITTING AND SMOKING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0081 POINTED TO THESE SIGNS ANGRILY AND READ THEM OUT LOUD WE KNEW THEN THAT THESE WRITINGS SIGNIFIED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0082 NO SMOKING AND DON'T SPIT THEN IN THE EVENINGS AFTER THE CROWD HAD GONE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0083 THE SAME AGED MALE WITH ONE LEG OF WOOD SWEPT UP THE PEANUT SHELLS WITH A BROOM EVERY NIGHT AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0084 WHILE HE WAS SO DOING HE ALWAYS WHISTLED THE SAME TUNE TO HIMSELF
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0085 THIS MELODY WE RATHER LIKED AND WE LEARNED THAT TOO BY HEART
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0086 THINKING IT WAS PART OF THE LANGUAGE THUS A WHOLE YEAR WENT BY IN THIS DISMAL PLACE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0087 SOME DAYS NEW FISHES WERE BROUGHT IN TO THE OTHER TANKS AND OTHER DAYS OLD FISHES WERE TAKEN OUT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0088 AT FIRST WE HAD HOPED WE WOULD ONLY BE KEPT HERE FOR A WHILE AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0089 THAT AFTER WE HAD BEEN LOOKED AT SUFFICIENTLY WE WOULD BE RETURNED TO FREEDOM AND THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0090 BUT AS MONTH AFTER MONTH WENT BY AND WE WERE LEFT UNDISTURBED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0091 OUR HEARTS GREW HEAVY WITHIN OUR PRISON WALLS OF GLASS AND WE SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER LESS AND LESS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0092 ONE DAY WHEN THE CROWD WAS THICKEST IN THE BIG ROOM A WOMAN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0093 WITH A RED FACE FAINTED FROM THE HEAT I WATCHED THROUGH THE GLASS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0094 AND SAW THAT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE GOT HIGHLY EXCITED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0095 THOUGH TO ME IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0096 THEY THREW COLD WATER ON HER AND CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0097 THIS MADE ME THINK MIGHTILY AND PRESENTLY A GREAT IDEA BURST UPON ME SISTER I SAID
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0098 TURNING TO POOR CLIPPA WHO WAS SULKING AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR PRISON
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0099 TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND A STONE FROM THE STUPID GAZE OF THE CHILDREN WHO THRONGED ABOUT OUR TANK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0100 SUPPOSING THAT WE PRETENDED WE WERE SICK DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD TAKE US ALSO FROM THIS STUFFY HOUSE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0101 BROTHER SAID SHE WEARILY THAT THEY MIGHT DO
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0102 BUT MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD THROW US ON A RUBBISH HEAP WHERE WE WOULD DIE IN THE HOT SUN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0103 BUT SAID I WHY SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD TO SEEK A RUBBISH HEAP
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0104 WHEN THE HARBOR IS SO CLOSE WHILE WE WERE BEING BROUGHT HERE I SAW MEN THROWING THEIR RUBBISH INTO THE WATER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0105 IF THEY WOULD ONLY THROW US ALSO THERE WE COULD QUICKLY REACH THE SEA THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0106 MURMURED POOR CLIPPA WITH A FARAWAY LOOK IN HER EYES SHE HAD FINE EYES HAD MY SISTER CLIPPA
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0107 HOW LIKE A DREAM IT SOUNDS THE SEA OH BROTHER WILL WE EVER SWIM IN IT AGAIN THINK YOU
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0108 EVERY NIGHT AS I LIE AWAKE ON THE FLOOR OF THIS EVIL SMELLING DUNGEON
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0109 I HEAR ITS HEARTY VOICE RINGING IN MY EARS HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR IT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0110 JUST TO FEEL IT ONCE AGAIN THE NICE BIG WHOLESOME HOMELINESS OF IT ALL TO JUMP
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0111 JUST TO JUMP FROM THE CREST OF AN ATLANTIC WAVE LAUGHING IN THE TRADE WIND'S SPINDRIFT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0112 DOWN INTO THE BLUE GREEN SWIRLING TROUGH
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0113 TO CHASE THE SHRIMPS ON A SUMMER EVENING WHEN THE SKY IS RED AND THE LIGHT'S ALL PINK WITHIN THE FOAM
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0114 TO LIE ON THE TOP IN THE DOLDRUMS NOONDAY CALM AND WARM YOUR TUMMY IN THE TROPIC SUN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0115 TO WANDER HAND IN HAND ONCE MORE THROUGH THE GIANT SEAWEED FORESTS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0116 SEEKING THE DELICIOUS EGGS OF THE POP POP TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE CASTLES OF THE CORAL TOWNS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0117 WITH THEIR PEARL AND JASPER WINDOWS SPANGLING THE FLOOR OF THE SPANISH MAIN TO PICNIC IN THE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0118 ANEMONE MEADOWS DIM BLUE AND LILAC GRAY THAT LIE IN THE LOWLANDS BEYOND THE SOUTH SEA GARDEN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0119 TO THROW SOMERSAULTS ON THE SPRINGY SPONGE BEDS OF THE MEXICAN GULF
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0120 TO POKE ABOUT AMONG THE DEAD SHIPS AND SEE WHAT WONDERS AND ADVENTURES LIE INSIDE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0121 AND THEN ON WINTER NIGHTS WHEN THE NORTHEASTER WHIPS THE WATER INTO FROTH TO SWOOP DOWN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0122 AND DOWN TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD DOWN TO WHERE THE WATER'S WARM AND DARK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0123 DOWN AND STILL DOWN TILL WE SPY THE TWINKLE OF THE FIRE EELS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0124 FAR BELOW WHERE OUR FRIENDS AND COUSINS SIT CHATTING ROUND THE COUNCIL GROTTO CHATTING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0125 BROTHER OVER THE NEWS AND GOSSIP OF THE SEA OH AND THEN SHE BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0126 SNIFFLING STOP IT I SAID YOU MAKE ME HOMESICK LOOK HERE LET'S PRETEND WE'RE SICK OR BETTER STILL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0127 LET'S PRETEND WE'RE DEAD AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY THROW US ON A RUBBISH HEAP AND WE FRY IN THE SUN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0128 WE'LL NOT BE MUCH WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE HERE IN THIS SMELLY PRISON
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0129 WHAT DO YOU SAY WILL YOU RISK IT I WILL SHE SAID AND GLADLY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0130 SO NEXT MORNING TWO FIDGITS WERE FOUND BY THE KEEPER FLOATING ON THE TOP OF THE WATER IN THEIR TANK STIFF
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0131 AND DEAD WE GAVE A MIGHTY GOOD IMITATION OF DEAD FISH ALTHOUGH I SAY IT MYSELF
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0132 THE KEEPER RAN AND GOT THE OLD GENTLEMEN WITH SPECTACLES AND WHISKERS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0133 THEY THREW UP THEIR HANDS IN HORROR WHEN THEY SAW US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0134 LIFTING US CAREFULLY OUT OF THE WATER THEY LAID US ON WET CLOTHS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0135 THAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF ALL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0136 IF YOU'RE A FISH AND GET TAKEN OUT OF THE WATER YOU HAVE TO KEEP OPENING AND SHUTTING YOUR MOUTH TO BREATHE AT ALL AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0137 EVEN THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP UP FOR LONG AND ALL THIS TIME WE HAD TO STAY STIFF AS STICKS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0138 AND BREATHE SILENTLY THROUGH HALF CLOSED LIPS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0139 WELL THE OLD FELLOWS POKED US AND FELT US AND PINCHED US TILL I THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER BE DONE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0140 THEN WHEN THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED A MOMENT A WRETCHED CAT GOT UP ON THE TABLE AND NEARLY ATE US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0141 LUCKILY THE OLD MEN TURNED ROUND IN TIME AND SHOOED HER AWAY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0142 YOU MAY BE SURE THOUGH THAT WE TOOK A COUPLE OF GOOD GULPS OF AIR WHILE THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0143 THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED US FROM CHOKING I WANTED TO WHISPER TO CLIPPA TO BE BRAVE AND STICK IT OUT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0144 BUT I COULDN'T EVEN DO THAT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW MOST KINDS OF FISH TALK CANNOT BE HEARD
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0145 NOT EVEN A SHOUT UNLESS YOU'RE UNDER WATER THEN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0146 JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO GIVE IT UP AND LET ON THAT WE WERE ALIVE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0147 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY LIFTED US UP AND CARRIED US OUT OF THE BUILDING
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0148 NOW FOR IT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WE'LL SOON KNOW OUR FATE LIBERTY OR THE GARBAGE CAN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0149 OUTSIDE TO OUR UNSPEAKABLE HORROR HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR A LARGE ASH BARREL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0150 WHICH STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A YARD MOST HAPPILY FOR US HOWEVER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0151 WHILE HE WAS CROSSING THIS YARD
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0152 A VERY DIRTY MAN WITH A WAGON AND HORSES DROVE UP AND TOOK THE ASH BARREL AWAY I SUPPOSE IT WAS HIS PROPERTY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0153 THEN THE OLD MAN LOOKED AROUND FOR SOME OTHER PLACE TO THROW US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0154 HE SEEMED ABOUT TO CAST US UPON THE GROUND BUT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0155 HE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THE YARD UNTIDY AND HE DESISTED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0156 THE SUSPENSE WAS TERRIBLE HE MOVED OUTSIDE THE YARD GATE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0157 AND MY HEART SANK ONCE MORE AS I SAW THAT HE NOW INTENDED TO THROW US IN THE GUTTER OF THE ROADWAY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0158 BUT FORTUNE WAS INDEED WITH US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0159 A LARGE MAN IN BLUE CLOTHES AND SILVER BUTTONS STOPPED HIM IN THE NICK OF TIME
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0160 EVIDENTLY FROM THE WAY THE LARGE MAN LECTURED AND WAVED A SHORT THICK STICK IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES OF THE TOWN TO THROW DEAD FISH IN THE STREETS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0161 AT LAST TO OUR UNUTTERABLE JOY THE OLD MAN TURNED AND MOVED OFF WITH US TOWARDS THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0162 HE WALKED SO SLOWLY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY AND WATCHING THE MAN IN BLUE OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE THAT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0163 I WANTED TO BITE HIS FINGER TO MAKE HIM HURRY UP
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0164 BOTH CLIPPA AND I WERE ACTUALLY AT OUR LAST GASP FINALLY HE REACHED THE SEA WALL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0165 AND GIVING US ONE LAST SAD LOOK HE DROPPED US INTO THE WATERS OF THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0166 NEVER HAD WE REALIZED ANYTHING LIKE THE THRILL OF THAT MOMENT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0167 AS WE FELT THE SALT WETNESS CLOSE OVER OUR HEADS WITH ONE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0168 FLICK OF OUR TAILS WE CAME TO LIFE AGAIN THE OLD MAN WAS SO SURPRISED
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0169 THAT HE FELL RIGHT INTO THE WATER ALMOST ON TOP OF US
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0170 FROM THIS HE WAS RESCUED BY A SAILOR WITH A BOAT HOOK
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0171 AND THE LAST WE SAW OF HIM THE MAN IN BLUE WAS DRAGGING HIM AWAY BY THE COAT COLLAR LECTURING HIM AGAIN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0172 APPARENTLY IT WAS ALSO AGAINST THE RULES OF THE TOWN TO THROW DEAD FISH INTO THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0173 BUT WE WHAT TIME OR THOUGHT HAD WE FOR HIS TROUBLES WE WERE FREE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0174 IN LIGHTNING LEAPS IN CURVING SPURTS IN CRAZY ZIG ZAGS WHOOPING SHRIEKING WITH DELIGHT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0175 WE SPED FOR HOME AND THE OPEN SEA THAT IS ALL OF MY STORY AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0176 I WILL NOW AS I PROMISED LAST NIGHT TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY ASK ABOUT THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0177 ON CONDITION THAT I AM SET AT LIBERTY AS SOON AS YOU HAVE DONE THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0178 IS THERE ANY PART OF THE SEA DEEPER THAN THAT KNOWN AS THE NERO DEEP I MEAN THE ONE NEAR THE ISLAND OF GUAM
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0179 THE FIDGIT WHY CERTAINLY THERE'S ONE MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0180 BUT IT'S SMALL AND HARD TO FIND WE CALL IT THE DEEP HOLE AND THERE'S ANOTHER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0181 IN THE ANTARCTIC SEA THE DOCTOR CAN YOU TALK ANY SHELLFISH LANGUAGE YOURSELF THE FIDGIT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0182 NO NOT A WORD WE REGULAR FISHES DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SHELLFISH WE CONSIDER THEM A LOW CLASS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0183 THE DOCTOR BUT WHEN YOU'RE NEAR THEM CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND THEY MAKE TALKING I MEAN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0184 WITHOUT NECESSARILY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SAY THE FIDGIT ONLY WITH THE VERY LARGEST ONES
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0185 SHELLFISH HAVE SUCH WEAK SMALL VOICES IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY BUT THEIR OWN KIND TO HEAR THEM
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0186 BUT WITH THE BIGGER ONES IT IS DIFFERENT THEY MAKE A SAD BOOMING NOISE RATHER LIKE AN IRON PIPE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0187 BEING KNOCKED WITH A STONE ONLY NOT NEARLY SO LOUD OF COURSE THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0188 I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TO STUDY MANY THINGS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0189 BUT WE LAND ANIMALS AS YOU NO DOUBT KNOW ARE UNABLE TO BREATHE UNDER WATER
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0190 HAVE YOU ANY IDEAS THAT MIGHT HELP ME THE FIDGIT I THINK THAT FOR BOTH YOUR DIFFICULTIES
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0191 THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO WOULD BE TO TRY AND GET HOLD OF THE GREAT GLASS SEA SNAIL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0192 THE DOCTOR ER WHO OR WHAT IS THE GREAT GLASS SEA SNAIL THE FIDGIT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0193 HE IS AN ENORMOUS SALT WATER SNAIL ONE OF THE WINKLE FAMILY BUT AS LARGE AS A BIG HOUSE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0194 HE TALKS QUITE LOUDLY WHEN HE SPEAKS BUT THIS IS NOT OFTEN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0195 HE CAN GO TO ANY PART OF THE OCEAN AT ALL DEPTHS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0196 BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF ANY CREATURE IN THE SEA HIS SHELL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0197 IS MADE OF TRANSPARENT MOTHER O PEARL SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0198 BUT IT'S THICK AND STRONG WHEN HE IS OUT OF HIS SHELL AND
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0199 HE CARRIES IT EMPTY ON HIS BACK THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR A WAGON AND A PAIR OF HORSES
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0200 HE HAS BEEN SEEN CARRYING HIS FOOD IN IT WHEN TRAVELING THE DOCTOR I
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0201 FEEL THAT THAT IS JUST THE CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0202 HE COULD TAKE ME AND MY ASSISTANT INSIDE HIS SHELL AND WE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0203 COULD EXPLORE THE DEEPEST DEPTHS IN SAFETY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET HIM FOR ME

tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0240 HE WAS SO WEARY THAT HE HAD HARDLY PUT THE TANK BACK UPON THE TABLE AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0241 WHEN HIS EYES CLOSED AND HE BEGAN TO SNORE IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0242 POLYNESIA SCRATCHED ANGRILY AT THE DOOR I ROSE AND LET HER IN
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0243 A NICE STATE OF AFFAIRS SHE STORMED WHAT SORT OF A SHIP IS THIS
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0244 THERE'S THAT COLORED MAN UPSTAIRS ASLEEP UNDER THE WHEEL THE DOCTOR ASLEEP DOWN HERE
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0245 AND YOU MAKING POT HOOKS IN A COPY BOOK WITH A PENCIL
tis-20080416-tou/wav/voy0246 EXPECT THE SHIP TO STEER HERSELF TO BRAZIL WE'RE JUST DRIFTING AROUND THE SEA LIKE AN EMPTY BOTTLE AND

TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
TJS-20090115-jsy/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT

tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
tkelley353-20090430-bti/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
tkelley353-20090430-hxn/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
tkelley353-20090430-zof/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
tkelley353-20090501-bxj/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
tkelley353-20090501-qsf/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
TLC-20091027-ysp/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0022 PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
tmarkus-20080919-hhv/wav/a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
tmarkus-20080919-nyg/wav/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
tmarkus-20080919-trq/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER

tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID

tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED

tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE 
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER 
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
tomhannen-20080409/wav/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-01 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP-EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-02 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-03 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-04 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-05 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-06 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-07 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-08 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-09 AH INDEED
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-10 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-11 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-12 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-13 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-14 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-15 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-16 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-17 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-18 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-19 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-20 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-21 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-22 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-23 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-24 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-25 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-26 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-27 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-28 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-29 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-30 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-31 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-32 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-33 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-34 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-35 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-36 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-37 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-38 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-39 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
tomhannen-20080409/wav/vf9-40 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
tomhannen-20080410-bfg/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
tomhannen-20080410-hlb/wav/b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
tomhannen-20080410-hxs/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
tomhannen-20080410-idz/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
tomhannen-20080410-nrf/wav/b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
tomhannen-20080410-tsg/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
tomhannen-20080410-vrp/wav/b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
tomhannen-20080410-ynw/wav/b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT

tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
tomhannen-20080411-aeb/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE

tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
tomhannen-20080411-bqm/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
tomhannen-20080411-cmx/wav/b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
tomhannen-20080411-cnt/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT

tomhannen-20080411-djj/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
tomhannen-20080411-djj/wav/a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
tomhannen-20080411-djj/wav/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM

tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
tomhannen-20080411-dwh/wav/b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
tomhannen-20080411-ebw/wav/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW

tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
tomhannen-20080411-ely/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND

tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
tomhannen-20080411-epi/wav/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD

tomhannen-20080411-ium/wav/a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
tomhannen-20080411-kvt/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
tomhannen-20080411-lvm/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS

tomhannen-20080411-lvm/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON

tomhannen-20080411-qvl/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
tomhannen-20080411-qvl/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
tomhannen-20080411-qvl/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
tomhannen-20080411-qvl/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
tomhannen-20080411-qvl/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS

tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
tomhannen-20080411-qxk/wav/a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
tomhannen-20080411-rfx/wav/b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
tomhannen-20080411-rfx/wav/b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
tomhannen-20080411-rfx/wav/b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED

tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER

tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
tomhannen-20080411-rmh/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
tomhannen-20080411-sbn/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE

tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0389 MAB SHE SAID
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
tomhannen-20080411-vds/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
tomhannen-20080411-xpi/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
tomhannen-20080411-xzk/wav/a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
tomhannen-20080411-ybm/wav/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
tomhannen-20080411-yvm/wav/a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
tomhannen-20080411-yvy/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
tomhannen-20080411-zcb/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
tomhannen-20080411-zib/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
tomhannwn-20080411-acr/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
tomhannwn-20080411-zsu/wav/b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
topherfangio-20080604-dgk/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
topherfangio-20080604-edr/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
topherfangio-20080604-egr/wav/a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-ejv/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
topherfangio-20080604-fcf/wav/b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-feu/wav/b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
topherfangio-20080604-fvf/wav/a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
topherfangio-20080604-hkl/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
topherfangio-20080604-imo/wav/a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
topherfangio-20080604-ira/wav/b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
topherfangio-20080604-jvb/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
topherfangio-20080604-kzc/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
topherfangio-20080604-nan/wav/a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
topherfangio-20080604-nhn/wav/b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
topherfangio-20080604-nnk/wav/a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
topherfangio-20080604-nvd/wav/a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg/wav/a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
topherfangio-20080604-qut/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
topherfangio-20080604-rrw/wav/b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
topherfangio-20080604-sci/wav/a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
topherfangio-20080604-spf/wav/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
topherfangio-20080604-sxs/wav/b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/rb-01 HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
topherfangio-20080604-tgh/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING-FEAST
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-tjf/wav/b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
topherfangio-20080604-trp/wav/a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
topherfangio-20080604-twl/wav/b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
topherfangio-20080604-wvs/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-wyz/wav/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
topherfangio-20080604-xmp/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
Toyo-20080229-ogz.zip/wav/a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
tozden-20090830-irc/wav/a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
tozden-20090830-lfh/wav/rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
tristau-20090801-jli/wav/b0457 AND SALVATION
tristau-20090801-jli/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
tristau-20090801-jli/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
tristau-20090801-jli/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM

ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT

ts87-20090126-etq/wav/a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
ts87-20090126-gzh/wav/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU

ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
ts87-20090126-iop/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE

ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
ts87-20090126-omo/wav/a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER

ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE-GREEN GOLD-GREEN AND A COPPER-GREEN
ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
ts87-20090126-wns/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER

uklebot-20090813-yez/wav/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
uklebot-20090813-yez/wav/a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE

uklebot-20090813-zxl/wav/a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS

unbridledrage-20090106-bvx/wav/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx/wav/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT

unbridledrage-20090106-clj/wav/b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING

unbridledrage-20090106-dho/wav/b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
unbridledrage-20090106-dho/wav/b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
unbridledrage-20090106-dho/wav/b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
unbridledrage-20090106-dho/wav/b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
unbridledrage-20090106-dho/wav/b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
unbridledrage-20090106-drs/wav/b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk/wav/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs/wav/b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej/wav/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
unbridledrage-20090106-han/wav/a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0313 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf/wav/a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER-SKELTER SORT OF WAY
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx/wav/b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf/wav/a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
unbridledrage-20090106-koj/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/wav/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb/wav/rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
unbridledrage-20090106-ton/wav/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
unbridledrage-20090106-toy/wav/a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
unbridledrage-20090106-uco/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY-THRILL
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt/wav/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
unknow-20090722-qcs/wav/b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
V-20080316-flc/wav/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
V-20080316-ilo/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
V-20080318-gwt/wav/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
vertago1-20090805-dka/wav/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0204 THE WOLF-DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
vertago1-20090805-ead/wav/a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
vertago1-20090805-efa/wav/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
vertago1-20090805-hyu/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
vertago1-20090805-mda/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
vertago1-20090805-mfz/wav/a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
vertago1-20090805-qla/wav/ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
vertago1-20090805-qrc/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
vikramjb-20080416-cls/wav/a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED-LEG BY THE NECK
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF-COCK THAT WAY
vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US

vince-20071118-tez/wav/b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
Vistaus-20080718-ngb/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
Vistaus-20080718-ngb/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
Vistaus-20080718-ngb/wav/b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
Vistaus-20080718-ngb/wav/b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
Vistaus-20080718-ngb/wav/b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON

voxforgeivr-20070410-062052-1176186024.14/wav/vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
voxforgeivr-20070410-062052-1176186024.14/wav/vf3-07 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
voxforgeivr-20070410-062052-1176186024.14/wav/vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
voxforgeivr-20070410-062052-1176186024.14/wav/vf3-09 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
voxforgeivr-20070410-062052-1176186024.14/wav/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
voxforgeivr-20070411-033712-1176262604.15/wav/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST

voxforgeivr-20070411-155616-1176306896.24/wav/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
voxforgeivr-20070411-155616-1176306896.24/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
voxforgeivr-20070411-155616-1176306896.24/wav/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
voxforgeivr-20070419-173040-1177003754.110/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
voxforgeivr-20070419-173040-1177003754.110/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE

voxforgeivr-20070419-173040-1177003754.110/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
voxforgeivr-20070419-173040-1177003754.110/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
voxforgeivr-20070422-194116-1177270851.20/wav/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
voxforgeivr-20070422-194116-1177270851.20/wav/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
voxforgeivr-20070422-194116-1177270851.20/wav/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
voxforgeivr-20070422-194116-1177270851.20/wav/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
voxforgeivr-20070422-194116-1177270851.20/wav/vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED

voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
voxforgeivr-20070422-195107-1177271401.21/wav/vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE

voxforgeivr-20070424-061119-1177395043.273/wav/vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
voxforgeivr-20070424-061119-1177395043.273/wav/vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
voxforgeivr-20070424-061119-1177395043.273/wav/vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
voxforgeivr-20070424-061119-1177395043.273/wav/vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
voxforgeivr-20070424-133837-1177421886.282/wav/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
voxforgeivr-20070424-133837-1177421886.282/wav/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
voxforgeivr-20070424-133837-1177421886.282/wav/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
voxforgeivr-20070424-133837-1177421886.282/wav/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
voxforgeivr-20070424-133837-1177421886.282/wav/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION

voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
voxforgeivr-20070424-140447-1177423443.287/wav/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF

voxforgeivr-20070425-202830-1177532882.342/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
voxforgeivr-20070425-202830-1177532882.342/wav/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
voxforgeivr-20070425-202830-1177532882.342/wav/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
voxforgeivr-20070425-202830-1177532882.342/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
voxforgeivr-20070425-202830-1177532882.342/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
voxforgeivr-20070425-203800-1177533460.345/wav/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES

voxforgeivr-20070425-204859-1177534103.347/wav/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
voxforgeivr-20070425-204859-1177534103.347/wav/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
voxforgeivr-20070425-204859-1177534103.347/wav/vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
voxforgeivr-20070425-204859-1177534103.347/wav/vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
voxforgeivr-20070425-204859-1177534103.347/wav/vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
voxforgeivr-20070426-160856-1177603699.363/wav/vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
voxforgeivr-20070426-160856-1177603699.363/wav/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
voxforgeivr-20070426-160856-1177603699.363/wav/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
voxforgeivr-20070426-160856-1177603699.363/wav/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK

voxforgeivr-20070609-101755-1181384172.1718/wav/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
voxforgeivr-20070609-101755-1181384172.1718/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
voxforgeivr-20070609-101755-1181384172.1718/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
voxforgeivr-20070609-101755-1181384172.1718/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
voxforgeivr-20070615-055404-1181886804.1954/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED

voxforgeivr-20070623-173331-1182619979.2351/wav/vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
voxforgeivr-20070624-024231-1182652857.2352/wav/vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
voxforgeivr-20070624-024231-1182652857.2352/wav/vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
voxforgeivr-20070624-024231-1182652857.2352/wav/vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE-GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
voxforgeivr-20070624-024231-1182652857.2352/wav/vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE

voxforgeivr-20080702-034856-1214970500.59/wav/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
voxforgeivr-20080702-034856-1214970500.59/wav/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-01 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-02 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-03 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-04 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
voxforgeivr-20080702-040147-1214971274.60/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
voxforgeivr-20080706-020319-1215309760.107/wav/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
voxforgeivr-20080706-020319-1215309760.107/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
voxforgeivr-20080706-020319-1215309760.107/wav/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
voxforgeivr-20080706-020319-1215309760.107/wav/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES

voxforgeivr-20080708-204603-1215549937.169/wav/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
voxforgeivr-20080708-204603-1215549937.169/wav/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
voxforgeivr-20080708-204603-1215549937.169/wav/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD

voxforgeivr-20080714-191104-1216062627.13/wav/vf5-09 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
voxforgeivr-20080714-191104-1216062627.13/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED

voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
voxforgeivr-20080723-044054-1216787970.8/wav/vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
voxforgeivr-20080725-124233-1216989719.56/wav/vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY

voxforgeivr-20081212-193759-1229110649.72/wav/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
voxforgeivr-20081212-193759-1229110649.72/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
voxforgeivr-20081212-193759-1229110649.72/wav/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
voxforgeivr-20081230-221715-1230675393.147/wav/vf4-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
voxforgeivr-20081230-221715-1230675393.147/wav/vf4-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
voxforgeivr-20081230-221715-1230675393.147/wav/vf4-08 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
voxforgeivr-20081230-221715-1230675393.147/wav/vf4-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
voxforgeivr-20081230-221715-1230675393.147/wav/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER

voxforgeivr-20090101-101818-1230805073.227/wav/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
voxforgeivr-20090101-101818-1230805073.227/wav/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
voxforgeivr-20090101-101818-1230805073.227/wav/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
voxforgeivr-20090101-101818-1230805073.227/wav/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
voxforgeivr-20090106-013645-1231205767.332/wav/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
voxforgeivr-20090106-013645-1231205767.332/wav/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP

voxforgeivr-20090111-180553-1231697118.514/wav/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
voxforgeivr-20090111-180553-1231697118.514/wav/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
voxforgeivr-20090111-180553-1231697118.514/wav/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
voxforgeivr-20090111-180553-1231697118.514/wav/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY

voxforgeivr-20090122-204014-1232656771.756/wav/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
voxforgeivr-20090131-000019-1233359978.995/wav/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN

voxforgeivr-20090208-190655-1234119974.1182/wav/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
voxforgeivr-20090219-184559-1235069115.1410/wav/vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
voxforgeivr-20090219-184559-1235069115.1410/wav/vf6-02 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE

voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-26 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB-THIEVES

voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-31 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
voxforgeivr-20090312-134153-1236865270.1846/wav/vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-01 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-02 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-03 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-04 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-05 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-06 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
voxforgeivr-20090313-145420-1236956007.1872/wav/vf8-07 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-16 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-17 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-19 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-20 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-21 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-22 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-23 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-24 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-26 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
voxforgeivr-20090315-043646-1237091769.1890/wav/vf8-27 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
voxforgeivr-20090315-201527-1237148085.1892/wav/vf8-31 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
voxforgeivr-20090315-201527-1237148085.1892/wav/vf8-32 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
voxforgeivr-20090315-201527-1237148085.1892/wav/vf8-33 BROKEN-TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
voxforgeivr-20090315-201527-1237148085.1892/wav/vf8-34 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
voxforgeivr-20090315-201527-1237148085.1892/wav/vf8-35 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
voxforgeivr-20090315-205917-1237150725.1894/wav/vf3-01 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
voxforgeivr-20090315-205917-1237150725.1894/wav/vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
voxforgeivr-20090315-205917-1237150725.1894/wav/vf3-03 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
voxforgeivr-20090315-205917-1237150725.1894/wav/vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
voxforgeivr-20090315-205917-1237150725.1894/wav/vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
vschum-20090719-dob/wav/a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
vschum-20090719-hak/wav/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
vschum-20090719-hfr/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
vschum-20090719-ktq/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
vschum-20090719-rjj/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv/wav/b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv/wav/b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY

wajkordanii-20081116-ggv/wav/b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK

whappy-20090617-ltq/wav/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED

whappy-20090617-ltq/wav/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-01 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-02 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-03 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-04 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-05 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-06 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-07 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-08 YOU WERE ENGAGED
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-09 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID

wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-11 WHAT'S THAT GRUB-THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-12 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-13 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-14 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-15 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-16 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-17 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-18 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-19 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-20 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-21 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-22 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-23 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES

wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-30 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-31 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-32 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-33 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-34 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-35 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-36 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-37 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-38 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-39 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
wicke-20071121/wav/vf21-40 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
wicke-20090313-dcc/wav/b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0031 THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
wicke-20090313-dga/wav/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
wicke-20090313-hep/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
wicke-20090313-vzl/wav/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
wicke-20090313-wnm/wav/b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
wicke-20090313-yxo/wav/b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
wicke-20090314-bhq/wav/a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0328 PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
wicke-20090314-fdu/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
wicke-20090314-jqn/wav/a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-21 A FULL-BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND-HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
wicke-20090314-jtl/wav/rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
wicke-20090314-jzq/wav/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0337 BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
wicke-20090314-poa/wav/a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
wicke-20090314-tdm/wav/a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
wicke-20090314-wup/wav/a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0329 AH INDEED
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0330 RED-EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED-LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0335 RED-EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
wicke-20090314-xkm/wav/a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG-FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
wicke-20090314-znl/wav/b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
wicke-20090316-wii/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
wolktm-20090114-kly/wav/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
xaviergonz-20080419-myf/wav/a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
xaviergonz-20080419-uje/wav/a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-03 BUILT-IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON-SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL-ESTATE
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv/wav/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND-YEARS-LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
XCoder-20090528-ddj/wav/a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS

xenobyte72-20080530-pgo/wav/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
xenobyte72-20080530-pgo/wav/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM

xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0324 IT WAS NOT RED-EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0325 WHIZ-ZIP-BANG LOP-EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
xtophe-20080924-ejb/wav/a0329 AH INDEED

xtophe-20080924-hsu/wav/b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
xtophe-20080924-hsu/wav/b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR

xtophe-20080924-hsu/wav/b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
xtophe-20080924-hsu/wav/b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
xtophe-20080924-hsu/wav/b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
xtophe-20080924-oqk/wav/a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
xtophe-20080924-oqk/wav/a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
xtophe-20080924-oqk/wav/a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
xtophe-20080924-oqk/wav/a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK

xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
xtophe-20080924-pqx/wav/b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES

xtophe-20080924-ulu/wav/b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0189 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY

xtophe-20080924-wcq/wav/a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
xtophe-20080924-xog/wav/b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
xtophe-20080924-xog/wav/b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
